    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="reason" type="string">
        If the asset is allowed or blocked, this will be the reason why.
        ChainPatrol aggregates data from multiple sources, so this will
        tell you which source blocked or allowed the asset.

        - `eth-phishing-detect` - the asset is on MetaMask's blocklist
        - `reported` - the asset is on ChainPatrol's blocklist because it was reported by a user

Our mission at ChainPatrol is to protect your community and brand from scammers.

* üñ•Ô∏è Our 24/7 Monitoring detects scammers targeting your community across X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Telegram, and Google Ads.

* üîê **ChainPatrol** gets these scams blocked at the wallet level, preventing users from signing malicious transactions.

* ü§ù We are working with Metamask and other wallets on a blocklist that warns users when they go to a scam URL or are about to transfer to a scammer's wallet address.

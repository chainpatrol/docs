Within ChainPatrol, all data belongs to a Workspace. Within a workspace, you can have multiple
Brands that represent different products/services/brands that belong to you.

## Workspace

Workspaces are the top-level entity in ChainPatrol. They are used to group all the data that belongs to you
and your organization. You can have multiple workspaces, but typically you'll only have the one that we set up for you.
You can think of a workspace similar to workspace in Slack or Linear where you can invite team members and view data at a high level.

## Brand

Brands are used to represent different products/services/brands that belong to you. You can have multiple brands within a workspace.
If you have a company that has multiple products, you can create a brand for each product. For example, a company called "Acme" that has
two products "Acme Wallet" and "Acme Exchange" can create two brands "Acme Wallet" and "Acme Exchange" within the "Acme" workspace.

There are two types of brands in ChainPatrol:

1. Services
2. People

### Services

Services represent products or services that are uniquely branded. Separating out brands allows you to configure specific detection settings
and assets that are unique to that brand, which improves the accuracy of the detections.

### People

People represent important individuals that are part of your organization. This could be an executive like your CEO, CTO, or any other important person that
you want to monitor for impersonation.

## Asset

Assets are the entities that you want to monitor for impersonation. Assets can be domains, social media accounts, or any other online entity
that we support in ChainPatrol. You can add multiple assets to a brand, and we will use these assets to compare detections against to determine
if there is evidence of impersonation or phishing.

## Report

Reports are the most important entity in ChainPatrol. Reports are created when we detect a potential impersonation or phishing attempt. Reports
contain all the information about the detection and proposed actions that ChainPatrol will take on your behalf to remove the threat.

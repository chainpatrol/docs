### Link Organization

<Warning>
  This step needs to be done with help from ChainPatrol staff in order for the
  Slack Bot to work properly.
</Warning>

**Please send ChainPatrol staff your workspace's Slack Team ID so that we can finish the automated pipeline.**

- Follow [Slack's documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/221769328-Locate-your-Slack-URL-or-ID#free,-pro-and-business+-subscriptions-2) to locate your Team ID.

<Tip>
  Slack refers to the Team ID as "workspace or org ID".

`https://app.slack.com/client/TXXXXXXX/CXXXXXXX`

In the above URL, the Team ID is the slug that begins with `T`.

</Tip>

## Usage

Once the bot is added to your workspace and you have **sent ChainPatrol your Team ID**, you can use the following actions:

### Slash Commands

- `/chainpatrol <url>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL

### Shortcut Actions

For a given message, click on the kebab menu and then select the `Create Report` option.

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and the Slack ID of the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any sensitive information about the workspace it is added to.

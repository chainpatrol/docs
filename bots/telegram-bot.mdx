If you have a **Telegram group**, you can use the ChainPatrol Telegram Bot to let your group members submit scam reports to **ChainPatrol**. The bot will generate new reports that get sent to your admin dashboard for review.

## Setup

### Bot Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Bot to Your Group Chat">
    <Warning>
      **Beware of impersonators!** The official ChainPatrol Telegram bot is `@ChainPatrol_Bot`. If you see any other bot claiming to be the ChainPatrol bot, please report it to us.
    </Warning>
    Start by adding the ChainPatrol Telegram Bot to your group chat. You can find the bot by searching for its username in Telegram.

## Usage

Once the bot is added to your group and the connection process is complete, you can use the following commands:

### Commands

- `/report <url> <description>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL with a brief description of why it's suspicious
- `/check <url>` - Check if a URL is on the block list
- `/setupstatus` - Find out if this chat group is associated with an organization
- `/setupconnect` - Generates the URL to link Telegram group to organization
- `/help` - Display a list of available commands and their descriptions

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and the Telegram ID of the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any sensitive information about the group it is added to.

<Tip>

The ChainPatrol Telegram bot is like any group user. You can adjust permissions
according to your group's needs.

If you have a **Telegram group**, you can use the ChainPatrol Telegram Bot to let your group members submit scam reports to **ChainPatrol**. The bot will generate new reports that get sent to your admin dashboard for review.

## Setup

### Bot Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Bot to Your Group Chat">
    Start by adding the ChainPatrol Telegram Bot to your group chat. You can find the bot by searching for its username in Telegram.

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and the Telegram ID of the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any sensitive information about the group it is added to.

If you have a **Discord server**, you can use the [ChainPatrol Discord bot](https://chainpatrol.io/bot)
to let your server members submit scam reports to **ChainPatrol**. The bot will generate new
reports that get sent to your admin dashboard for review.

## Setup

<Tip>
  If you have a dedicated `scam-reports` channel, we recommend pinning a message
  in this channel and directing your server members to use the bot there for
  easy reporting
</Tip>

### Install the bot

To add the bot to your server, you need to be an admin of the server. Then, you
can use the following link to add the bot:

[ðŸš€ Add ChainPatrol to your server](https://chainpatrol.io/bot/install)

Next, you need to configure the bot to send reports to your admin dashboard on ChainPatrol. Right now,
this is can be done by reaching out to us [via email](mailto:support@chainpatrol.io?subject=%5BDiscord%20Bot%5D%20Setup%20integration%20with%20ChainPatrol&body=Hi,%20I%20would%20like%20to%20link%20the%20Discord%20bot%20to%20my%20ChainPatrol%20account%20as%20described%20here:%20https://chainpatrol.io/docs/general/discord-bot.%0A%0AThanks!)
and letting us know that you want to add the bot to your server. We will create an organization
for you on ChainPatrol and you can then use the `/setup connect` slash command to link your Discord server
to your organization on ChainPatrol.

To check that the bot is working, you can use the `/setup status` command to see if the bot is
connected to your ChainPatrol organization.

## Features

### Scam Reports

The bot allows server members to submit scam reports directly to ChainPatrol.

#### Usage

Once the bot is added to your server, you can use the following commands:

- `/report <url>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL
- `/check <url>` - Check if the given URL is a scam

#### Example

Here is an example of how to use the bot to submit a scam report:

### Reports Feed

You can create a feed channel of all reports to your organization. This feature allows you to see all scam reports submitted through the bot in a dedicated channel.

#### Setup

1. Create a new channel on your Discord server and name it something like `chainpatrol-reports`
2. Use the following command to link the channel to your ChainPatrol organization:
   ```
   /setup feed <channel>
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the bot's response to link the channel to your ChainPatrol organization

![Image showing the Discord bot's response to the setup feed command](/images/discord-bot-feed-setup.png)

You can check that the feed is connected correctly by running the `/setup status` command. If the
feed is connected correctly, you should see the channel name in the bot's response.

![Image showing the Discord bot's response to the setup status command after setting up the feed](/images/discord-bot-feed-status.png)

As a final test, you can try submitting a test scam report using the `/report` command. You should see a message
in the feed channel with the scam report shortly after submitting.

### Link Monitoring

ChainPatrol can monitor your Discord channels for suspicious links and automatically take action when they are detected. This feature helps protect your community from scams and malicious content.

#### Setup

To enable link monitoring in a channel:

1. Navigate to the channel you want to monitor
2. Run the `/setup linkmonitoring` command
3. Confirm the setup when prompted

<Tip>
  Only server administrators or users with "Manage Server" permissions can
  enable link monitoring
</Tip>

#### How it Works

Once enabled, ChainPatrol will:

1. Monitor all messages in the configured channel for URLs
2. Check each URL against ChainPatrol's comprehensive blocklist, which includes:
   - Known scam websites
   - Phishing attempts
   - Malicious domains
   - Other security threats reported to ChainPatrol
3. Take action based on your server's configuration when suspicious links are detected

<Tip>
  The blocklist is continuously updated with new threats reported by the
  ChainPatrol community and security researchers. You can [search through our
  blocklist](https://app.chainpatrol.io/search) to see what threats we're
  protecting against.
</Tip>

#### Response Actions

When a suspicious link is detected, ChainPatrol can be configured to:

- **React with ðŸš¨** - Adds a warning reaction to the message
- **Delete the message** - Automatically removes the message
- **Notify moderators** - Sends an alert to your moderator channel

<Tip>
  The response action is configured by your server administrator through the
  ChainPatrol dashboard
</Tip>

#### Example

Here's what happens when a suspicious link is detected:

## Common Issues

### Custom Elevated Permissions

- Bot role may need elevated permission to interact with private channels

- If you are adding the bot to a channel that is not normally visible to `@everyone`, then you will need to
  Slash commands not visible to Discord members

- Embed links permissions are required for your reports feed

- Make application commands available to users
  - Server members will not be able to use the ChainPatrol bot commands if they do not have access to application commands

## Debugging Tips

### View Server As Role

- You can right click the ChainPatrol role in server settings to see the server as the bot role

  <Frame>![view as role](/images/discord-view-as-role.png)</Frame>

<Tip>
  Trying to access a feature in an inaccessible part of the server will lead to
  an error. Make sure the bot's permissions can see and interact with what you
  are debugging.

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and
the Discord ID for the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs
more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any information
about the server it is added to.

## Source Code

The source code for the bot is available on GitHub:

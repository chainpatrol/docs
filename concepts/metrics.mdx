description: "Understanding how ChainPatrol measures and reports threat protection"
---

## Definition

<Info>
**Metrics** are the high-level numbers and charts ChainPatrol shows to summarize how many threats we're seeing, how many we've blocked or taken down, and how quickly we're responding over a chosen time period.
</Info>

They are built by aggregating your organization's activity (reports, detections, blocked assets, takedowns) into simple, readable summaries.

### Why It Matters

<Card title="Answer the Key Question" icon="circle-question">
  Metrics help you answer **"Are we protected?"** by showing threat volume, coverage, and response quality to your internal stakeholders and, when enabled, to external audiences via your Security Portal.
</Card>

## Key Characteristics

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Organization-Specific" icon="building">
    **Tied to your organization**
    
    Metrics are always calculated for a specific **organization**, and reflect only that organization's reports, threats, and takedown activity.
    
    **What this means:**
    - You only see your organization's data
    - No cross-organization visibility
    - Customized to your brands and assets
    - Reflects your specific threat landscape
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Time-Bound" icon="clock">
    **Summary over a period**
    
    Every metrics view uses a time window (e.g., "last 30 days" or a custom range chosen via the date filter).
    
    **Common time periods:**
    - Last 7 days
    - Last 30 days
    - Last 90 days
    - Custom date range
    
    <Note>
    The same metric (e.g., "New Threats") may look very different depending on the period you select.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Filterable" icon="filter">
    **Segmented by multiple dimensions**
    
    Many metrics can be filtered by **brand** and broken down by:

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Metrics Relate to Other Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assets and Asset Scans" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **From scans to metrics**
    
    When asset scans and reviews lead to an asset being **blocked**, that asset contributes to metrics such as:
    - **New Threats**
    - **Threats by asset type**
    - **Threats blocked per day**
    
    Ongoing scans and liveness updates ensure that metrics reflect the current state of your threat surface (e.g., how many blocked assets are still alive).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Threats / Detections" icon="radar">
    **Detection to metric pipeline**
    
    Every detection or blocked asset rolls up into counts like:
    - **New threats**
    - **Detections by type**
    - **Domains blocked**
    
    Metrics summarize how much malicious activity is being found and neutralized for your organization over time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reports and Reviews" icon="clipboard-check">
    **From reports to action**
    
    - **Reports** raised by your team or users drive the **Reports** metric
    - Review outcomes (e.g., approving a threat as real and blocking it) flow into threat and takedown metrics
    - Shows how well your review process is keeping up with incoming threats
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Takedowns" icon="power-off">
    **Takedown effectiveness**
    
    Takedown records power:
    - **Takedowns Filed** and **Takedowns Completed**
    - **Median time to takedown** per asset type and category
    
    These metrics show how quickly threats are being removed once identified.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Brands and Services" icon="building">
    **Service impact on visibility**
    
    - Metrics can be filtered by **brand** to show which brands are most targeted
    - Enabling services like **detection**, **reviewing**, **takedowns**, and **wallet blocking** typically increases visibility in metrics (more threats found, blocked, and removed) rather than reducing numbers to zero
    
    <Note>
    Higher threat counts don't mean you're less secure—they mean you're detecting more threats that were always there.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

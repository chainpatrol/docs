---

## What Is an Allowlist?

An **allowlist** is a curated list of known, trusted assets that are explicitly recognized as legitimate within ChainPatrol.

<Info>
Assets added to the allowlist are considered **official or approved** and are treated differently from unknown or suspicious assets during threat detection and analysis.
</Info>

Allowlisting helps ChainPatrol distinguish between genuine brand-owned content and potential impersonation or abuse.

<Check>
Unlike blocklists, which focus on malicious content, allowlists define what is **known to be safe**.
</Check>

## Why We Use an Allowlist at ChainPatrol

Allowlists play a critical role in improving both **detection accuracy** and **signal quality**.

### Dual Purpose

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exclusion from Detection" icon="shield-check">
    **Preventing false positives**
    
    When an asset is allowlisted, it is excluded from automatic threat detection.
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Prevents legitimate brand-owned assets from being mistakenly flagged as impersonation
    - Reduces false positives
    - Eliminates unnecessary investigations
    - Improves team efficiency
    
    **Example:**
    Your official website `example.com` is allowlisted, so it will never be flagged as a phishing site, even if detection rules would normally trigger on brand-related keywords.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reference Baseline" icon="ruler">
    **Comparison for threat analysis**
    
    Allowlisted assets are used as **reference points** when analyzing potentially malicious content.
    
    **How it works:**
    ChainPatrol can compare a suspected phishing page against an allowlisted official website to determine whether:
    - Branding is being copied
    - Layout is being imitated
    - Content is being duplicated
    - Visual elements are being stolen
    
    **Example:**
    A suspicious site `examp1e.com` is detected. ChainPatrol compares it against your allowlisted `example.com` and identifies:
    - 95% visual similarity
    - Identical logo usage
    - Copied page structure
    - **Result:** High-confidence brand impersonation detection
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
This dual role—exclusion from detection and use as a trusted baseline—makes allowlists essential for reliable brand impersonation analysis.
</Note>

## What Can Be Allowlisted?

<Info>
Allowlisting is not limited by platform or asset category, as long as the asset is known to be legitimately controlled by the organization or brand.
</Info>

## What Should and Shouldn't Be Allowlisted?

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Should NOT Be Allowlisted ❌

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Third-Party Content" icon="users">
    Content that is merely tolerated but not controlled by your organization.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Partner websites mentioning your brand
    - News articles about your company
    - Third-party reviews or comparisons
    - Affiliate or reseller sites
    
    <Warning>
    Even if the content is positive or authorized, if you don't control it, don't allowlist it.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User-Generated Content" icon="comments">
    Content created by users, even on your platforms.
    
    **Examples:**
    - User profiles on your platform
    - Community-submitted content
    - User comments or posts
    - Customer testimonials on external sites
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Assets Not Fully Controlled" icon="question">
    Assets where you don't have complete control or ownership.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Shared hosting environments
    - Third-party integrations
    - External widgets or embeds
    - Temporary or borrowed infrastructure
    
    <Note>
    If there's any doubt about control or ownership, err on the side of caution and don't allowlist.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Important:** Allowlisting an asset implicitly signals trust. Because allowlisted assets are excluded from automatic detection, incorrectly allowlisting an asset can reduce visibility into real threats.
</Warning>

## Risk Handling and Escalation

Allowlisting does not permanently exempt an asset from scrutiny.

<Info>
If an allowlisted asset shows suspicious behavior or is believed to be compromised, it can still be escalated, investigated, and acted upon.
</Info>

### Compromise Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Account Compromise" icon="user-lock">
    **Scenario:** Your official Twitter account is hacked
    
    **What happens:**
    1. Asset is allowlisted, so automatic detection doesn't flag it
    2. Community reports suspicious activity
    3. Manual investigation reveals compromise
    4. Asset is temporarily removed from allowlist
    5. Threat is blocked and reported
    6. After recovery, asset is re-allowlisted
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Domain Hijacking" icon="globe">
    **Scenario:** Your domain is hijacked or DNS is compromised
    
    **What happens:**
    1. Asset is allowlisted, so automatic detection doesn't flag it
    2. Monitoring detects unusual behavior or content changes
    3. Security team investigates
    4. Asset is removed from allowlist during incident
    5. Malicious content is blocked
    6. After resolution, asset is re-allowlisted
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Infrastructure Breach" icon="server">
    **Scenario:** Your hosting infrastructure is compromised
    
    **What happens:**
    1. Allowlisted assets start serving malicious content
    2. User reports or automated monitoring detect anomalies
    3. Incident response is triggered
    4. Affected assets are removed from allowlist
    5. Threats are contained and remediated
    6. Assets are re-allowlisted after verification
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
This ensures that trust is not absolute and that compromised official assets do not become blind spots.
</Check>

## Granularity of Allowlists

Allowlists in ChainPatrol can be configured at different levels.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Organization Level" icon="building">
    **Applies across all brands**
    
    Assets allowlisted at the organization level are trusted for the entire organization, regardless of which brand they're associated with.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Corporate websites
    - Shared infrastructure
    - Company-wide social accounts
    - Central authentication systems
    
    **Example:**
    `company.com` is allowlisted at the organization level, protecting it for all brands under the organization.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Brand Level" icon="tag">
    **Applies only to a specific brand**
    
    Assets allowlisted at the brand level are trusted only for that specific brand within the organization.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Product-specific websites
    - Brand-specific social accounts
    - Individual product infrastructure
    - Brand-specific campaigns
    
    **Example:**
    `product-a.com` is allowlisted for "Product A" brand but not for "Product B" brand.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
This flexibility allows teams managing multiple brands to tailor trust appropriately.
</Info>

### Hierarchy Example

```
Organization: Acme Corp
├── Brand: Acme Protocol

└── Organization-level allowlist:
    ├── acme.com (All brands)
    ├── @AcmeCorp (All brands)
    └── support@acme.com (All brands)

## Who Can Update the Allowlist?

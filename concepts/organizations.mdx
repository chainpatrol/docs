## Your Workspace in ChainPatrol

Everything you see and do in ChainPatrol happens inside an **Organization**. Think of it as your team's dedicated workspace where you manage your brands, track your assets, and measure how ChainPatrol is protecting you from threats.

<Info>
An organization is the top-level container for all your security operations, team members, and protected assets in ChainPatrol.
</Info>

## How ChainPatrol Manages Security for You

ChainPatrol is a **fully managed security product**. This means our team handles the heavy lifting:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Day-to-Day Threat Hunting" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Continuous scanning across platforms
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Suspicious Activity Review" icon="clipboard-check">

### Your Level of Involvement

That said, you're not locked out of the process. If you want your team to be more hands-on, you can:

    Invite team members into your organization's dashboard with customized permissions and roles.
  </Tab>

    **Report Threats**
    
    Your team can report threats they discover through the dashboard or integrations.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Approval Workflow" icon="check-double">
    **Approve or Decline**
    
    Review and approve specific takedowns or blocklist decisions before they take effect.

  <Tab title="Integrations" icon="plug">
    **Connect Tools**

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
You decide how involved you want to be—from fully hands-off to deeply integrated with your team's operations.
</Note>

## Brands and Assets

Every organization has one or more **brands** that ChainPatrol protects.

### What is a Brand?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Brand Definition" icon="building">
    A brand could be:
    - Your company name
    - A product line
    - Your executives or key personnel
    - A key identity that attackers might try to impersonate
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Brand Impersonation Detection" icon="user-secret">
    We use brands to detect **brand impersonation** attacks:
    - Lookalike domains
    - Fake social profiles
    - Scam campaigns borrowing your brand's name
    - Imagery or messaging designed to trick people
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What are Assets?

In addition to brands, your organization also has **assets**—the digital properties that actually belong to you:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Websites" icon="globe">
    Domains and web applications
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Social Accounts" icon="share-nodes">
    Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="App Listings" icon="mobile">
    App store and extension marketplace listings
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Wallet Addresses" icon="wallet">
    Blockchain addresses and contracts
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Email Addresses" icon="envelope">
    Official company and team emails
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Other Properties" icon="link">
    GitHub repos, forums, documentation sites
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
We track your official assets so we can spot copycats and **general phishing** pages that mimic your legitimate sites or channels. When we find something suspiciously similar to your assets but not actually yours, it gets flagged for review.
</Info>

## Services You Can Enable

Each organization can turn individual services on or off depending on what you need. These services control which ChainPatrol features are active for your organization:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Detection" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Enables ChainPatrol's automated scanning across the web, social platforms, app stores, and other sources. When this is turned on, we continuously look for new threats targeting your brands.
    
    **Status:** Foundation service—required for all other services
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitoring & Reporting" icon="chart-line">
    Activates the systems that collect and organize reports and detections into a single view. This powers your dashboards and ensures you have up-to-date visibility into what's happening.
    
    **Status:** Recommended for all organizations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reviewing" icon="clipboard-check">
    Turns on ChainPatrol's review workflows, where our team validates suspicious assets and decides whether they should be blocked, allowed, watchlisted, or escalated.
    
    **Status:** Recommended for accuracy and quality control
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Obligatory Organization Admin Approval" icon="user-shield">
    Adds a final approval step for specific types of assets. When enabled, you choose which asset categories (like domains, social media, or messaging platforms) require explicit confirmation from an admin in your organization before ChainPatrol's blocklist decisions take effect.
    
    **Configuration:** If you don't select any specific types, all asset types will require approval.
    
    **Status:** Optional—for organizations requiring internal oversight
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wallet Blocking" icon="wallet">
    Allows approved crypto-related threats to be added to ChainPatrol's global blocklist, which is consumed by partner wallets like Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask to protect their users from known malicious addresses.
    
    **Status:** Essential for Web3 organizations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Takedowns" icon="power-off">
    Enables ChainPatrol to file takedown requests with hosting providers, registrars, and platforms on your behalf. When this service is on, we don't just block threats—we work to get them removed from the internet entirely.
    
    **Requirements:** Legal documentation (trademark proof, authorized representative details)
    
    **Status:** Recommended for comprehensive protection
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automated Takedowns" icon="bolt">
    Speeds up the takedown process for clear-cut cases. Once you've provided the required legal documents (like a Power of Attorney) and your main website URL, ChainPatrol can automatically submit takedown requests for approved threats without waiting for manual back-and-forth on every case.
    
    **Requirements:** 
    - Power of Attorney document
    - Main website URL
    - All other services enabled
    
    **Status:** Advanced—for high-volume threat environments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

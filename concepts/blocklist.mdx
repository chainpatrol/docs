## What is a Blocklist?

A blocklist (also known as a denylist) is a database of confirmed malicious entities that should be blocked or flagged to protect users. In the context of web3 security, a blocklist contains verified phishing websites, scam social media accounts, fraudulent crypto addresses, and other malicious assets that pose a threat to users.

<Info>
ChainPatrol's blocklist functions as a **threat intelligence database** that's continuously updated and distributed in real-time.
</Info>

### Real-Time Protection

Unlike traditional security databases that may update daily or weekly, our blocklist provides immediate updates as threats are confirmed, ensuring protection is deployed within **15-30 minutes** rather than hours or days.

<Check>
The blocklist serves as the foundation of proactive security—instead of waiting for users to encounter threats, we identify, verify, and distribute threat intelligence to prevent exposure before it happens.
</Check>

## Why Do We Use a Blocklist and Why Is It Effective?

### The Problem with Traditional Takedowns

Traditional cybersecurity approaches rely heavily on **takedowns**—requesting hosting providers or domain registrars to remove malicious content. However, this approach has critical limitations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Slow Response Times" icon="clock">
    4-48 hours for hosting providers, 24-72 hours for domain takedowns
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Incomplete Coverage" icon="circle-xmark">
    Some providers never respond or operate in non-cooperative jurisdictions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Attack Window" icon="stopwatch">
    Scammers can steal funds within minutes of launching a phishing site
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Whack-a-Mole" icon="hammer">
    Attackers quickly spin up new domains or move to different providers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### The Blocklist Advantage

ChainPatrol's blocklist provides **immediate protection** through a "blocklist-first, takedown-second" approach:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Speed">
    Assets are blocklisted and distributed in **15-30 minutes** after confirmation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Universal Coverage">
    Protection works regardless of hosting provider, jurisdiction, or whether the malicious content remains online
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Point-of-Access Protection">
    Blocks are enforced at the browser, wallet, and network level—where users actually interact with threats
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Persistent Protection">
    Even if a scammer sets up 100 copycat sites, each one gets blocklisted as soon as it's detected
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
In web3, where transactions are irreversible and scams can drain wallets in seconds, **prevention at the point of interaction is critical**.
</Warning>

### Network Effects

The effectiveness of our blocklist increases exponentially with distribution:

**One confirmation protects millions of users** across the entire web3 ecosystem.

## Who Contributes to the Blocklist?

ChainPatrol's blocklist is powered by a diverse network of contributors:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Community Reports" icon="users">
    **Grassroots threat intelligence**
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="End Users" icon="user">

    **Human verification layer**
    
    While many sources contribute **detections**, all blocklist entries are verified by ChainPatrol's security team before being added.
    
    **Why this matters:**
    - Ensures accuracy
    - Minimizes false positives
    - Maintains blocklist quality
    - Provides human judgment for edge cases
    
    <Note>
    This human-in-the-loop review process is critical for maintaining trust in the blocklist.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Is In Scope for Being Added to the Blocklist?

Assets are added to the blocklist when they meet two criteria: **intent** and **confirmation**.

### Intent: Malicious Purpose

Assets must demonstrate clear malicious intent:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Phishing" icon="fishing-rod">
    Sites designed to steal credentials, seed phrases, or private keys
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Scams" icon="sack-dollar">
    Fraudulent schemes (fake airdrops, rug pulls, Ponzi schemes)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Impersonation" icon="user-secret">

  <Card title="Malware Distribution" icon="virus">
    Sites or links that distribute malicious software
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Social Engineering" icon="brain">
    Content designed to manipulate users into compromising security
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Confirmation: Evidence-Based Verification

Assets must be confirmed as malicious through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Multiple Credible Reports">
    Independent sources reporting the same threat
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Evidence of Attacks">
    Proof of successful attacks or victim reports
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Technical Analysis">
    Malicious code or behavior detected
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pattern Matching">
    Clear alignment with known attack techniques
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Brand Owner Confirmation">
    Verification of unauthorized use (when applicable)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Out of Scope

The following are **not** added to the blocklist:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legitimate Criticism" icon="comment">
    Negative reviews, critical commentary, or parody (protected speech)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Competitor Content" icon="building">
    Content from legitimate competitors, even if unfavorable

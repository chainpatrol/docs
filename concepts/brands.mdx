### Brand Terms

<Accordion title="What are Brand Terms?" icon="text" defaultOpen>
  Brand terms are **keywords associated with a brand** that describe how the brand is commonly referenced online.
  
  **They include:**
  - Official brand names
  - Variations and abbreviations
  - Product names
  - Nicknames or widely used informal names
  - Individual names (for personal brands)
  
  **Examples for "ChainPatrol":**
  - ChainPatrol
  - Chain Patrol
  - CP
  - @chainpatrol

</Accordion>

<Info>
By defining brand terms, ChainPatrol is able to recognize when content is likely related to a specific brand and assess whether that content may be legitimate or potentially impersonating the brand.
</Info>

### Brand Images

<Accordion title="What are Brand Images?" icon="image" defaultOpen>
  Brand images include visual elements that represent the brand.
  
  **They include:**
  - Logos (all variations)
  - Official graphics and design elements
  - Profile photos for individuals
  - Brand marks and symbols
  - Visual identity assets
  
  **How they're used:**
  
  These images are used during detection to help identify potential impersonation, for example by matching logos or profile photos against suspicious content that may be attempting to mimic the brand.
</Accordion>

### Brand Assets

<Accordion title="What are Brand Assets?" icon="link" defaultOpen>
  Brand assets represent **known, legitimate assets owned by the brand**.
  
  These are used to distinguish between real content and potentially harmful impersonation.

## How Brand Information Is Used

ChainPatrol combines **brand terms**, **brand images**, and **brand assets** to understand a brand's identity and accurately assign threats to the correct brand.

### The Attribution Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Threat Detection">
    Suspicious content is detected across the internet
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Brand Matching">
    ChainPatrol analyzes the content for:
    - Brand terms (name, keywords)
    - Brand images (logos, visuals)
    - Similarity to brand assets (mimicking official properties)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Attribution">
    The threat is automatically associated with the relevant brand
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Evaluation & Action">
    The threat is properly evaluated and acted upon in the context of that brand
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This attribution process happens automatically and at a high level, allowing threats to be categorized without requiring manual intervention in most cases.
</Info>

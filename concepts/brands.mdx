## Overview

A **brand** represents an identity that ChainPatrol protects.

<Info>
Brands belong to an **organization**, and a single organization can have **multiple brands**.
</Info>

## Types of Brands

ChainPatrol supports two types of brands:

### Company Brands

These represent the organization itself or its products. Examples include your primary brand (e.g., "ChainPatrol"), product lines or services, sub-brands created for specific business units, and regional or market-specific brands.

**Use Case:** A Web3 company protecting their main protocol name, their governance token, and their NFT marketplace brand.

### Individual Brands

These represent key people associated with the organization. Examples include CEO, executives, public-facing employees, founders, and brand ambassadors.

**Use Case:** Protecting a CEO who is frequently impersonated on Twitter/X and Telegram by scammers offering fake investment opportunities.

Both company and individual brands can be targeted by impersonation, scams, or fraud, and ChainPatrol protects both.

## What Information Is Stored in a Brand?

Each brand includes several components that help ChainPatrol understand what legitimate content looks like and identify potential threats.

### Brand Terms

Keywords associated with a brand that describe how the brand is commonly referenced online. They include official brand names, variations and abbreviations, product names, nicknames or widely used informal names, and individual names (for personal brands).

Examples for "ChainPatrol": ChainPatrol, Chain Patrol, CP, @chainpatrol, chainpatrol.io

By defining brand terms, ChainPatrol is able to recognize when content is likely related to a specific brand and assess whether that content may be legitimate or potentially impersonating the brand.

### Brand Images

Visual elements that represent the brand, including logos (all variations), official graphics and design elements, profile photos for individuals, brand marks and symbols, and visual identity assets.

These images are used during detection to help identify potential impersonation, for example by matching logos or profile photos against suspicious content that may be attempting to mimic the brand.

### Brand Assets

Known, legitimate assets owned by the brand. These are used to distinguish between real content and potentially harmful impersonation.

A brand asset can be any asset type supported by ChainPatrol: websites (official websites and domains), social media (Twitter, Discord, Telegram profiles), app listings (app store and extension listings), repositories (GitHub and code repositories), channels (Telegram channels and groups), and other properties (any verified online property).

Brand assets serve as a whitelist of what is considered authentic.

## How Brand Information Is Used

ChainPatrol combines brand terms, brand images, and brand assets to understand a brand's identity and accurately assign threats to the correct brand.

### The Attribution Process

1. **Threat Detection** - Suspicious content is detected across the internet
2. **Brand Matching** - ChainPatrol analyzes the content for brand terms (name, keywords), brand images (logos, visuals), and similarity to brand assets (mimicking official properties)
3. **Automatic Attribution** - The threat is automatically associated with the relevant brand
4. **Evaluation & Action** - The threat is properly evaluated and acted upon in the context of that brand

This attribution process happens automatically and at a high level, allowing threats to be categorized without requiring manual intervention in most cases.

### Example Attributions

**Domain Impersonation:** Domain `chainpatr0l-airdrop.com` uses ChainPatrol logo and mimics official website design. It matches brand term "chainpatrol" (with typo), matches brand image (official logo detected), and mimics brand asset (official website structure). Result: Automatically attributed to "ChainPatrol" brand.

**Social Media Impersonation:** Twitter account `@chainpatrol_support` with profile photo using ChainPatrol logo and bio mentioning "Official ChainPatrol Support". Matches brand term, matches brand image, impersonates brand asset. Result: Automatically attributed to "ChainPatrol" brand.

**Executive Impersonation:** Telegram account claims to be CEO with profile photo using CEO's headshot and messages offering investment opportunities. Matches brand term (CEO's name), matches brand image (CEO's photo), impersonates individual brand. Result: Automatically attributed to CEO's individual brand.

### Benefits of Accurate Attribution

- **Clear Visibility** - Organizations have clear visibility into which brands are being impersonated
- **Frequency Tracking** - Understand how frequently each brand is targeted
- **Action Association** - See which takedowns or mitigation actions are associated with each brand
- **Trend Analysis** - Identify patterns and emerging threats per brand

## Brands and Organizations

A single organization may be responsible for managing and protecting multiple brands.

### Common Multi-Brand Scenarios

**Corporate + Product Brands** - A company safeguarding both its corporate identity and several product lines. Example: Main brand "Acme Protocol" plus product brands "Acme Swap", "Acme Wallet", and "Acme DAO".

**Executive Protection** - Protecting individual executives or other public-facing staff members. Example: Main brand "Acme Protocol" plus individual brands "Jane Smith (CEO)", "John Doe (CTO)", and "Sarah Johnson (CMO)".

**Regional or Market Brands** - Maintaining distinct brands used across different markets, languages, or regions. Example: Main brand "Acme Protocol" plus regional brands "Acme Asia", "Acme Europe", and "Acme LATAM".

**Acquired Companies** - Managing brands from acquired companies while maintaining their separate identities. Example: Parent brand "Acme Holdings" plus acquired brands "Beta Protocol" and "Gamma Finance".

ChainPatrol keeps brand information structured and separate to ensure that each brand can be protected individually while still remaining clearly associated with the same organization.

### Organizational Benefits

**Granular Control** - Configure protection settings per brand, track metrics for each brand independently, assign different team members to different brands, customize detection rules by brand.

**Unified View** - See all brands in one dashboard, compare threat volumes across brands, aggregate metrics for reporting, maintain consistent policies across brands.

**Flexible Structure** - Add new brands as you grow, reorganize brands as needed, merge or split brands, maintain historical data.

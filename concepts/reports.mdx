## What is a Report?

A **Report** is how suspicious or safe activity gets submitted to ChainPatrol for review. Each report bundles together one or more assets, like websites, social profiles, or crypto addresses, along with the evidence needed to evaluate them.

<Info>
When you create a report, you're proposing that specific assets should either be **blocked** (because they're malicious) or **allowed** (because they're safe).
</Info>

## How Reports Get Reviewed

Every report that comes into your organization is reviewed by ChainPatrol's team.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Evidence Review">
    Reviewers examine the evidence, screenshots, and context provided
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Security Checks">
    Run automated security scans and analysis on the reported assets
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Decision">
    Decide whether each asset should be:
    - **Blocked** - Confirmed malicious
    - **Allowed** - Confirmed legitimate
    - **Watchlisted** - Monitored for changes
    - **Escalated** - Requires additional investigation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action">
    Apply the decision and update asset status
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Automatic Review

In some cases, the review happens automatically:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High Confidence Detection" icon="shield-check">
    When our systems have extremely high confidence that an asset is malicious.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Known wallet drainer script detected
    - Exact copy of known phishing site
    - Matches multiple high-confidence rules
    
    **Result:** Approved immediately without manual validation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Trusted Reporter" icon="user-shield">
    When the report comes from someone we've marked as a trusted reporter.
    
    **Who qualifies:**
    - Verified security researchers
    - Trusted partner organizations
    - ChainPatrol staff
    
    **Result:** Fast-tracked for approval
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Organization Admin Approval

<Warning>
If you've enabled **Obligatory Organization Admin Approval** for certain types of assets, there's an extra step.
</Warning>

Even after ChainPatrol's team approves a report, the changes won't be applied to your blocklist until someone from your organization with admin permissions confirms them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="ChainPatrol Review">
    Our team reviews and approves the report
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pending Admin Approval">
    Report waits for organization admin confirmation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Admin Confirms">
    Your admin reviews and approves or rejects
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action Applied">
    Asset status is updated based on final decision
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Report Status

Reports move through three stages as they're processed:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="TODO" icon="circle" color="#f59e0b">
    The report is waiting in the queue for review
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="IN_PROGRESS" icon="spinner" color="#3b82f6">
    ChainPatrol staff or automated systems are actively reviewing it
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="CLOSED" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    The review is complete and decisions have been made on all assets
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Status Transitions

## How to Submit a Report

Creating a report in ChainPatrol is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create Report">
    Start by clicking **Create Report** from the dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Assets">
    Paste in the assets you want to report, one per line:
    - URLs (e.g., `https://fake-metamask.com`)
    - Social media profiles (e.g., `@fake_support`)
    - Blockchain addresses (e.g., `0x123...`)
    - Any other asset type ChainPatrol monitors
    
    <Note>
    The system automatically figures out what kind of asset each one is, so you don't need to categorize them yourself.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Context">
    Provide information to help reviewers:
    
    **Title:**
    - Summarize what you're reporting
    - Be clear and concise
    - Example: "Fake MetaMask wallet drainer site"
    
    **Description:**
    - Explain why these assets are suspicious
    - Include any relevant details
    - Describe how you found them
    - Note any user reports or complaints
  </Step>

    - Screenshots of malicious content
    - User reports or messages
    - Social media posts
    - Any supporting documentation
    
    <Tip>
    Visual evidence helps reviewers quickly understand what's going on and speeds up the review process.

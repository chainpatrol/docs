title: URL
description: Represents a domain or subdomain to be reported
---

**URLs** are the most common type of asset. It is a string that is used to identify a resource on the Internet.

When you submit a report, if you select asset type as `URL`, the url string will be normalized and its domain will be submitted to **Chainpatrol**.

<Warning>
  For sites that host user-generated content, such as blogs, forums, and social
  (ex. Twitter) or link shortening services (ex. Bitly), blocking the domain is
  not feasible, since it will block all user-generated content. In these cases,
  you should report using the [PAGE](./page) asset type.
</Warning>

## Normalization

Normalization is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from the URL string. It is done to make the URL string more readable and to remove any ambiguity.

ChainPatrol performs the following normalization steps:

- Remove the scheme (http, https, ftp, etc.)
- Convert the domain to lowercase
- Convert unicode characters to [punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode)
- Remove username, password, port, query, fragment
- Remove trailing slash

#### Report

```
BLOCK https://www.chainpatrol.xyz/home
```

#### Result

When a domain is blocked, all subdomains of that domain are also blocked:

```
BLOCK chainpatrol.xyz
BLOCK *.chainpatrol.xyz
BLOCK *.*.chainpatrol.xyz
...
```

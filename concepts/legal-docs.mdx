## What Are Legal Documents?

**Legal documents** are official documents that prove a company's ownership rights, authorization, or identity when requesting the removal of harmful or fraudulent content.

<Info>
Many online platforms require verified legal documentation before they will act on a takedown request, especially when dealing with impersonation, trademark misuse, or brand-related abuse.
</Info>

### Why They're Required

These documents help providers confirm that the takedown request is legitimate and submitted by an authorized party.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Trademark Registration" icon="trademark">
    **Proof of brand ownership**
    
    <Card title="What It Is" icon="file-certificate">
      Official documentation proving that an organization legally owns a brand name, logo, or trademark.
    </Card>
    
    **When It's Required:**
    - Content is impersonating a brand
    - Misusing protected intellectual property
    - Claiming false association with trademark
    - Using brand elements without authorization
    
    **What It Includes:**
    - Trademark registration number

    - Description of protected marks
    - Visual representations (logos, wordmarks)
    - Goods and services covered
    
    **Common Formats:**

    - EUIPO certificates (European Union)
    - National trademark office documents
    - International (Madrid Protocol) registrations
    
    <Note>
    Providers often require this when content is impersonating a brand or misusing protected intellectual property.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Letter of Authorization (LOA)" icon="file-signature">
    **Authorization to act on behalf**
    
    <Card title="What It Is" icon="file-lines">
      A document in which the brand owner declares that ChainPatrol is authorized to submit takedown requests on their behalf.
    </Card>
    
    **Key Components:**
    - Organization's legal name and details
    - Statement of authorization
    - Specific actions ChainPatrol is authorized to perform

    **Typical Use Cases:**

    **Example Statement:**

    <Tip>
    LOAs are typically simpler and faster to obtain than Power of Attorney documents.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Power of Attorney (POA)" icon="gavel">
    **Formal legal authorization**
    
    <Card title="What It Is" icon="scale-balanced">
      A formal legal authorization allowing ChainPatrol to act for the organization in a broader or more formal capacity.

    **When It's Required:**
    - Domain suspensions

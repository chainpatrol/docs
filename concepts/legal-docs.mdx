## What Are Legal Documents?

**Legal documents** are official documents that prove a company's ownership rights, authorization, or identity when requesting the removal of harmful or fraudulent content.

<Info>
Many online platforms require verified legal documentation before they will act on a takedown request, especially when dealing with impersonation, trademark misuse, or brand-related abuse.
</Info>

### Why They're Required

These documents help providers confirm that the takedown request is legitimate and submitted by an authorized party.

- **Verify Identity** - Confirm the requesting party represents the organization
- **Prove Ownership** - Demonstrate legitimate ownership of brand or trademark
- **Establish Authority** - Show authorization to request content removal

## Types of Legal Documents

ChainPatrol typically works with the following categories of legal documentation:

### Trademark Registration

Official documentation proving that an organization legally owns a brand name, logo, or trademark.

**When It's Required:**
- Content is impersonating a brand
- Misusing protected intellectual property
- Claiming false association with trademark
- Using brand elements without authorization

**What It Includes:**
- Trademark registration number
- Registration date and jurisdiction
- Description of protected marks
- Visual representations (logos, wordmarks)
- Goods and services covered

**Common Formats:**
- USPTO registration certificates (United States)
- EUIPO certificates (European Union)
- National trademark office documents
- International (Madrid Protocol) registrations

Providers often require this when content is impersonating a brand or misusing protected intellectual property.

### Letter of Authorization (LOA)

A document in which the brand owner declares that ChainPatrol is authorized to submit takedown requests on their behalf.

**Key Components:**
- Organization's legal name and details
- Statement of authorization
- Specific actions ChainPatrol is authorized to perform
- Authorized representative's signature
- Date of authorization
- Contact information

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Social media takedowns (especially Twitter/X)
- App store removal requests
- Hosting provider complaints
- General brand protection activities

**Example Statement:**
> "[Organization Name] hereby authorizes ChainPatrol to submit takedown requests, abuse reports, and content removal requests on our behalf for the purpose of protecting our brand and trademarks from impersonation, fraud, and unauthorized use."

<Tip>
LOAs are typically simpler and faster to obtain than Power of Attorney documents.
</Tip>

### Power of Attorney (POA)

A formal legal authorization allowing ChainPatrol to act for the organization in a broader or more formal capacity.

**Key Differences from LOA:**
- More formal legal standing
- Broader scope of authority
- Often notarized or witnessed
- Recognized across more jurisdictions
- Required for high-impact actions

**When It's Required:**
- Domain suspensions
- TLD-level takedowns
- Registrar-level actions
- High-impact or escalated cases
- International jurisdictions

**What It Authorizes:**
- Filing formal legal complaints
- Representing the organization in takedown proceedings
- Making binding statements on behalf of the organization
- Escalating to legal authorities if needed

<Warning>
Some providers require a POA for escalated or high-impact takedowns such as domain suspensions.
</Warning>

### Document Usage Across Platforms

**Website Takedowns** (hosting providers and registrars) typically require trademark registration, LOA or POA, and business registration documents to verify legitimate brand ownership and confirm authorization to request removal.

**Social Media Takedowns** (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram) typically require LOA (especially for Twitter/X), trademark registration (for verified impersonation), and government-issued ID (for individual impersonation) to prevent abuse of reporting systems and verify authorized representatives.

**App Store Takedowns** (Google Play, Apple App Store) typically require trademark registration, LOA or POA, and proof of brand ownership to verify app infringement and confirm authorization to request removal.

**TLD-Level Takedowns** (top-level domain registries) typically require POA (formal authorization), trademark registration, and detailed evidence of abuse due to the high-impact nature of entire domain suspension and legal liability considerations.

## What Legal Documents Are Used For

Legal documents are attached to takedown submissions so platforms can verify that:

1. The requesting party truly represents the organization
2. The brand or trademark is legitimately owned
3. ChainPatrol has the authority to request removal of the content
4. The takedown request complies with the provider's legal requirements

<Warning>
Without these documents, many providers may refuse or delay action on a takedown request.
</Warning>

## How Legal Documents Are Stored

All legal documentation provided to ChainPatrol is handled with strong security controls.

### Secure Storage

Legal documents are stored in a secure storage bucket designed specifically to protect sensitive files.

**Security measures:**
- Restricted access (only authorized systems and personnel)
- Encryption (data encrypted at rest and in transit)
- Isolated storage (separated from general application data)
- Access logging (all access attempts are logged)
- Audit trail (complete history of document usage)
- Compliance (meets industry security standards)

### Limited Access

Only authorized ChainPatrol systems and personnel can access these documents.

**Who has access:**
- Takedown specialists (when processing requests)
- Legal team members (for review and verification)
- Authorized support staff (for customer assistance)
- Automated systems (for document attachment during submission)

**Access controls:**
- Role-based permissions
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Access logged and monitored
- Regular access reviews

Documents are used solely for the purpose of supporting takedown submissions.

### Usage Policy

Legal documents are not directly part of the takedown object—they are applied only during the submission process when a provider requires them.

**How it works:**

1. Takedown request is created for a malicious asset
2. System determines which provider to contact
3. System checks if provider requires legal documentation
4. If required, appropriate documents are automatically attached
5. Complete takedown request with documentation is submitted

This approach minimizes unnecessary exposure of sensitive documents while ensuring they're available when needed.

## Document Management Best Practices

**Keep Documents Current** - Update POA/LOA documents annually, refresh after organizational changes, update contact information promptly, and renew before expiration dates. Expired or outdated documents can delay takedown processing.

**Maintain Multiple Formats** - Keep documents in PDF (most common), scanned originals, notarized copies (for POA), and translated versions (for international takedowns) since different providers have different requirements.

**Coordinate with Legal Team** - Have legal team review documents, ensure authorized signatories, verify scope of authorization, and confirm compliance with company policies.

**Track Document Usage** - Track which providers accept which documents, note any rejection reasons, update documents based on feedback, and maintain records of successful takedowns.

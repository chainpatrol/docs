## What is a Review?

A **review** is a decision made on a **proposal** to either block or allow a reported asset. When someone reports a potentially malicious website, social media account, or other digital asset, ChainPatrol creates a proposal that requires review before taking action.

<Info>
Think of a review as the approval or rejection of a recommendation to block a threat.
</Info>

### Components of a Review

Each review consists of:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Decision" icon="check-double">
    Approve, reject, skip, or escalate
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Label" icon="tag">
    Type of threat (e.g., phishing, brand impersonation)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Comment" icon="comment">
    Optional reasoning explanation
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Reviewer" icon="user">

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Timestamp" icon="clock">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Who Can Review?

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Review Actions

There are four types of review decisions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Approve" icon="circle-check" defaultOpen>
    **What it means:**
    
    Confirms that the reported asset is malicious and should be blocked.
    
    **What happens:**
    - Asset is added to ChainPatrol's blocklist
    - Distributed to integrated platforms
    - Takedown process initiated (if enabled)
    - Organization is notified
    
    **When to use:**
    - Clear evidence of malicious activity
    - High confidence in threat assessment
    - Asset matches known attack patterns
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reject" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:**
    
    Indicates the reported asset is legitimate and should not be blocked.
    
    **Common reasons:**
    - The asset is actually official (false positive)
    - The threat has already been removed
    - Insufficient evidence of malicious activity
    - Misidentification or misunderstanding
    
    **What happens:**
    - Proposal is closed
    - Asset remains unblocked
    - Reporter may be notified
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Skip" icon="forward">
    **What it means:**
    
    Reviewer cannot make a definitive decision yet. This keeps the proposal in a pending state for another reviewer to examine.
    
    **Common reasons:**
    - Insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the threat
    - Need for additional context or investigation
    - Waiting for asset to load or become accessible
    - Requires more specialized expertise
    
    **What happens:**
    - Proposal remains in queue
    - Another reviewer will examine it
    - May be escalated if skipped multiple times
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Escalate" icon="arrow-up">
    **What it means:**
    
    Passes the review decision to another party for final judgment.
    
    **Escalation Types:**
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Escalate to Customer">
        Requests the brand owner to review and decide
        
        **When used:**
        - Staff reviewers are uncertain
        - Asset type requires customer approval
        - Content is ambiguous
        
        **What happens:**
        - Customer team receives notifications (Slack/Discord)
        - Proposal stays pending until customer decides
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Escalate to Team">
        Passes to senior ChainPatrol analysts
        
        **When used:**
        - Customer administrators are uncertain
        - Complex cases require expert review
        - Multiple conflicting signals
        
        **What happens:**
        - Routes to senior security analysts
        - In-depth analysis performed
        - Final decision made by experts
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Automated Review

The ChainPatrol automation system automatically reviews proposals under specific conditions:

### Auto-Approval Criteria

A proposal is **automatically approved** when:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trusted Reporter Submissions">
    Reports from trusted reporters are auto-approved if they don't trigger legitimacy warnings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="High Threat Score">
    Reports with a threat score of **1.0 or higher** are auto-approved if:
    - No legitimacy checks indicate the asset is legitimate
    - The organization doesn't require customer approval
    - There's no active dispute on the report
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Auto-Skip Criteria

A proposal is **automatically skipped** (sent for manual review) when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Legitimacy Detected" icon="shield-check">
    High-confidence rules indicate the asset appears legitimate
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Low Threat Score" icon="gauge-low">
    The threat score is below 1.0
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Customer Review Required" icon="user-check">
    Organization settings require manual approval from their team
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Active Dispute" icon="gavel">
    Someone has disputed the report
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rate Limit Exceeded" icon="stopwatch">
    Too many auto-approvals in a short time period
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Threat Scoring

<Info>
The automation system calculates a threat score by analyzing multiple factors.
</Info>

**Scoring Components:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Brand Impersonation" icon="user-secret">
    **Signals analyzed:**
    - Visual similarity to known brands
    - Logo matching
    - Name and text similarity
    - Domain typosquatting
    - Profile impersonation
    
    **Score range:** 0.0 - 1.0+
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="General Phishing" icon="fishing-rod">
    **Indicators checked:**
    - Credential harvesting forms
    - Suspicious URL patterns
    - Malicious links
    - Social engineering tactics
    - Wallet connection scams
    
    **Score range:** 0.0 - 1.0+
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Score Calculation" icon="calculator">
    **How it works:**
    
    The system takes the **maximum score** from each category and adds them together.
    
    **Example:**
    - Brand impersonation: 0.6
    - General phishing: 0.8
    - **Total score: 1.4** ✅ Auto-approved
    
    <Note>
    This ensures multiple detections don't artificially inflate the total.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Evidence Reviewed

When making a review decision, reviewers examine multiple types of evidence:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Detection Rules" icon="ruler">
    ChainPatrol runs automated detection rules that check for:

      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Phishing Indicators" icon="fishing-rod">
        Credential forms, suspicious URLs
      </Card>

      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Blockchain Threats" icon="link">
        Fake wallet connections, transaction scams
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>

    - Related threats from the same infrastructure
    - Pattern analysis across campaigns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Revert a Review

</Warning>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find Revert Section">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Revert">

## When Reviews Are Escalated

Reviews can be escalated in two directions:

## What is the Security Portal?

The **Security Portal** is your organization's public-facing page where people outside your team can report suspicious activity directly to ChainPatrol.

<Info>
It's a branded landing page that shows your organization's name and gives anyone with the link an easy way to submit threats they've encountered, whether that's a phishing site, a fake social profile, or a malicious app pretending to be yours.
</Info>

### Transparency Features

When the Security Portal is enabled, it can also display:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Public Reports" icon="flag">
    Show what threats have been reported and what action was taken
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Public Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Display high-level statistics about threats detected and addressed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Check>
This gives your community and stakeholders transparency into how actively threats are being detected and addressed for your organization.
</Check>

## Why Does It Exist?

The Security Portal serves two primary purposes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Community-Powered Protection" icon="users">
    **Make it easy for your community to help protect your brand**
    
    ### The Problem

    **Common barriers:**
    - No clear reporting channel
    - Complicated submission process
    - Requires account creation
    - Unclear if reports are acted upon
    
    ### The Solution
    
    The Security Portal gives them a simple, trusted place to submit that information directly to ChainPatrol.

## Where Do Community Reports Go?

When someone submits a report through your Security Portal, it flows into your organization's **Reports** page in the ChainPatrol dashboard, just like any other report.

### Report Processing Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submission">
    User submits report via Security Portal
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report Created">
    Report appears in your organization's Reports page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Process">
    ChainPatrol's team evaluates the evidence and runs security checks
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Decision">
    Determines whether reported assets should be blocked, allowed, or escalated
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Admin Approval (Optional)">
    If "Obligatory Organization Admin Approval" is enabled, your team confirms the action
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action Applied">
    Asset status is updated and distributed to blocklist
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
From there, the report goes through the same review process as any other submission.

## What Is a Takedown?

A **takedown** is a formal request asking an online platform to remove harmful, fraudulent, or unauthorized content.

<Info>
This request is sent to the organization responsible for hosting or displaying that content, such as a hosting provider, domain registrar, social media platform, app store, or TLD registry.

## The Purpose of Takedowns

Regardless of the platform, the purpose of a takedown is the same:

<Card title="Core Objective" icon="bullseye">
  **To remove dangerous or unauthorized content quickly, securely, and effectively.**

### Takedowns vs. Blocklisting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Takedowns" icon="power-off">
    **Complete removal from the internet**
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Content is permanently removed
    - Attackers lose their infrastructure
    - Prevents future victims from accessing
    - Demonstrates enforcement action
    
    **Disadvantages:**
    - Takes time (hours to days)
    - Some providers don't respond
    - Attackers can quickly create new sites
    - Jurisdiction and legal challenges
    
    **Best for:**
    - Long-term threat elimination
    - Persistent campaigns
    - High-profile impersonation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Blocklisting" icon="shield">
    **Immediate protection at point of access**
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Instant protection (15-30 minutes)
    - Works regardless of hosting provider
    - Protects even if content stays online
    - Universal coverage across platforms
    
    **Disadvantages:**
    - Content remains online
    - Requires integration with security tools
    - May not prevent all access methods
    
    **Best for:**
    - Immediate threat mitigation
    - Rapid response scenarios
    - Protecting users before takedown completes

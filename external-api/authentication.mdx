We use **API keys** to authenticate requests. You can get an API key from us
by [booking a demo](https://calendar.app.google/mbHSej2xYwa4X9b59).

## How to authenticate a request

To authenticate a request, you need to include a `X-CHAINPATROL-API-KEY` header
with the value of your API key in your request:

```bash
'X-CHAINPATROL-API-KEY': '<your api key>'
```

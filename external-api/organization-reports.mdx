## Quick Start

### Authentication

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header:

```bash
X-API-KEY: <api-key>
```

# Pagination

Make sure to use the `limit` and `cursor` parameters to paginate through the results.

# Filtering

## Dates

When filtering by dates you need to provide both the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters.

## Only Rejected

You can filter for only reports with a rejected proposals by setting the `onlyRejected` parameter to `true`.

The reports returned will have proposals inside, however not all proposals will be rejected, as a report can have multiple proposals inside, and some may be rejected while others are approved. So you need to look through the data if you want only rejected proposals.

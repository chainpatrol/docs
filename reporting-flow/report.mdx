Your team can always create a manual report through our security dashboard.
This is useful when your team detects an external scammer or your team has been
hacked. You can even temporarily block your own domains in the case of a DNS attack.

Your community can also submit reports on scam URLs and addresses through a
security portal created for your organization. You can see an example
here: [app.chainpatrol.io/chainpatrol](https://app.chainpatrol.io/chainpatrol).

The community reports will be scanned by our system to help prioritize critical
reports and remove spam.

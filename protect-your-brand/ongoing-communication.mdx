## Major Events

If your organization has upcoming launches, announcements, or major events, communication is critical:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share Event Details in Advance">
    Notify us as soon as you have event details to share
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="We Prepare Resources">
    This allows us to dedicate extra monitoring resources and prepare response plans

This guide explains the information ChainPatrol needs during onboarding and how to keep your organization's data up to date for effective threat protection.

## Overview

ChainPatrol protects your organization by monitoring for threats impersonating your brands, assets, and employees. To do this effectively, we need accurate and comprehensive information about:

## Managing Your Organization's Assets

  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Settings** > **Organization Assets**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Assets">
    Click **Add Asset** to include new properties

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Organize">
    Group assets to help organize by priority or type

### API Management

For organizations with many assets or frequent updates, you can manage assets programmatically using our API:

## The Onboarding Process

### Customer Information Sheet (CIS)

During onboarding, you'll receive a **Customer Information Sheet** to fill out. This comprehensive form captures all the information listed above.

<Warning>
**Best Practice:** Don't fill out the CIS alone. Share it with teams across your organization.
</Warning>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when someone leaves your company?" icon="user-minus">
    You should remove their email address and any personal accounts from your organization's asset list. This can be done through the Settings page or API.
    
    <Tip>
    We recommend integrating asset management with your employee offboarding process.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when you rebrand?" icon="paintbrush">
    Contact us immediately when planning a rebrand. We'll work with you to:
    
    1. Add new brand assets to your allowlist
    2. Update visual identity materials
    3. Keep old brand assets protected during the transition period
    4. Eventually remove outdated assets after the transition is complete

    **For acquisitions you make:**
    - Add the acquired brand as a sub-brand in your organization
    - Include all their assets in your allowlist
    - Keep existing POA/LOA documents for the acquired entity
    
    **For being acquired:**
    - Work with your new parent company to transfer ChainPatrol services
    - Legal documents may need to be updated to reflect the new ownership structure

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I manage multiple brands or subsidiaries?" icon="sitemap">
    Yes! Organizations can have multiple brands, each with their own:
    
    - Asset lists
    - Brand identity materials
    - Protected terms
    
    This is common for holding companies, investment firms, or organizations with multiple product lines.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often should I review my asset list?" icon="calendar-check">
    We recommend reviewing your assets:
    
    - **Quarterly**: Regular check-ins to catch gradual changes
    - **After launches**: New products, campaigns, or initiatives
    - **After reorganizations**: Mergers, acquisitions, or restructuring
    - **When prompted**: We'll notify you when it's time for a scheduled review
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If I'm unsure whether something should be included?" icon="circle-question">
    **When in doubt, include it.** It's better to have too many assets in your allowlist than to miss something.
    
    <Tip>
    Our team can help you refine your list during onboarding and ongoing reviews.

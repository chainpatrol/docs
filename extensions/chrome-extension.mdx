## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions for its functionality:

- **storage**: Stores your preferences, authentication status, selected organization, and temporarily caches form data across sessions for a better user experience.

- **tabs**: Gets the URL and domain of your current tab for reporting purposes. Also used to open new tabs for login and viewing submitted reports.

- **webNavigation**: Monitors page navigation to check destinations against blocklists. This allows the extension to potentially provide warnings before loading known malicious sites.

- **activeTab**: Provides a more limited way to access your current tab's URL when you explicitly click the extension icon.

- **cookies**: Reads authentication cookies specifically for the ChainPatrol domain to verify your login status without requiring repeated logins.

- **desktopCapture** (optional): Only requested when you enable screenshot functionality. Allows capturing images of suspicious sites to include with reports.

- **Host permissions** (app.chainpatrol.io): Required for the cookies permission to function correctly on the ChainPatrol domain.

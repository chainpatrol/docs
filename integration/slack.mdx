If you have a **Slack workspace**, you can use the ChainPatrol Slack Bot to let your workspace members submit scam reports to **ChainPatrol**. The bot will generate new reports that get sent to your admin dashboard for review.

## Setup

### Bot Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Admin Dashboard">
    Start by opening your dashboard on the [ChainPatrol app](https://app.chainpatrol.io/).

    <Frame>![Step 2 - Organization Settings](/images/organization-settings.png)</Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations Tab">
    Once you are in the organization settings, navigate to the **Integrations** tab. This section contains options for the Slack bot as well as other integrations.

    </Tip>

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Please avoid using organization-level installs for the
  ChainPatrol Slack Bot. Organization-level and enterprise installs can cause
  issues with the bot's functionality and may not properly integrate with your
  ChainPatrol dashboard. Always use workspace-level installations to ensure
  proper operation.
</Warning>

## Confirmation and Finalization

The ChainPatrol Slack Bot should appear in your listed apps along with other allowed workspace apps.

### Adding ChainPatrol Bot To Your Reporting Channel

<Warning>
  Remember to add the slack bot to the reporting channel! By default, the
  ChainPatrol bot does not automatically read and join existing channels for
  privacy.
</Warning>

### Link Organization

<Warning>
  This step needs to be done with help from ChainPatrol staff in order for the
  Slack Bot to work properly.
</Warning>

**Please send ChainPatrol staff your workspace's Slack Team ID so that we can finish the automated pipeline.**

- Follow [Slack's documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/221769328-Locate-your-Slack-URL-or-ID#free,-pro-and-business+-subscriptions-2) to locate your Team ID.

<Tip>
  Slack refers to the Team ID as "workspace or org ID".

`https://app.slack.com/client/TXXXXXXX/CXXXXXXX`

In the above URL, the Team ID is the slug that begins with `T`.

</Tip>

## Usage

Once the bot is added to your workspace and you have **sent ChainPatrol your Team ID**, you can use the following actions:

### Slash Commands

- `/chainpatrol <url>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL

### Shortcut Actions

For a given message, click on the kebab menu and then select the `Create Report` option.

## Threats Feed Configuration

In addition to submitting reports, the ChainPatrol Slack Bot can also send automated notifications about threats and reports to your Slack channels. This creates a real-time threats feed that keeps your team informed about security activity.

<Frame>![Blocklist Update Example](/images/blocklist-update.png)</Frame>

### Setting Up Notification Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Configure Notification Channel">
    Create a dedicated channel in your Slack workspace for receiving ChainPatrol threat notifications. This channel will serve as your organization's security feed for real-time threat intelligence.

    <Frame>![Add Bot to Channel](/images/add-to-channel.png)</Frame>

    <Warning>
      **Important**: You must add the ChainPatrol bot to this channel for notifications to work properly. The bot cannot automatically join channels for privacy and security reasons.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Channel Information to ChainPatrol">
    Contact ChainPatrol staff with your notification channel's Channel ID to complete the integration setup. The Channel ID is a unique identifier that begins with "C" and can be found in your channel's details.

    <Tip>
      To find your Channel ID, right-click on the channel name and select "View channel details" or check the URL when viewing the channel in your browser.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Integration Settings">
    Navigate to your ChainPatrol dashboard and go to **Settings** > **Integrations** to configure your notification preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Notification Preferences">
    Within the Integrations tab, locate the **Notification Settings** section to customize which types of security alerts your team receives.

    <Frame>![Notification Settings](/images/notification-settings.png)</Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Notification Types">
    Choose which notifications you want to receive for your organization's reports and monitored assets. Each option serves different security monitoring needs as detailed below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Notification Options

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="New Reports for Blocked Assets" icon="shield-exclamation">
    Receive notifications when new reports are created for assets that are
    already on your blocklist. This helps you track ongoing threats and see when
    community members are encountering known malicious content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Reports for Allowed Assets" icon="shield-check">
    Receive notifications when new reports are created for assets that are
    currently on your allowlist. This can help identify potential false
    positives or assets that may need review if they're receiving multiple
    reports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Assets Added to Blocklist" icon="shield-slash">
    Receive notifications when assets are confirmed as threats and added to the
    blocklist. **This is the most critical notification type** - when you see
    this alert, it means ChainPatrol's systems have confirmed a threat and are
    actively working to process it for takedown and blocklist distribution.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Recommended Configuration**: We recommend enabling all three notification
  types for comprehensive threat monitoring. However, if you want to focus on
  the most critical alerts, option 3 (Assets Added to Blocklist) provides
  notifications specifically for confirmed threats rather than just reports.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Notification settings only take effect if you have Discord or Slack reporting
  feeds enabled through the bot integration.
</Warning>

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and the Slack ID of the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any sensitive information about the workspace it is added to.

## Usage

<Tip>

Use the `/setupconnect` command to confirm the connection between your group and ChainPatrol.

</Tip>

Once the bot is added to your group and the connection process is complete, you can use the following commands:

### Commands

- `/report <url> <description>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL with a brief description of why it's suspicious
- `/check <url>` - Check if a URL is on the block list
- `/setupstatus` - Find out if this chat group is associated with an organization
- `/setupconnect` - Generates the URL to link Telegram group to organization
- `/help` - Display a list of available commands and their descriptions

## Features

### Auto-Link Monitoring

The ChainPatrol Telegram Bot automatically monitors all links shared in your group chat. This feature provides an additional layer of protection for your community:

- **Real-time Scanning**: Every link posted in the group is instantly checked against ChainPatrol's extensive database of known scams and malicious URLs.
- **Automatic Alerts**: If a potentially harmful link is detected, the bot immediately notifies the group, warning members about the potential risk.
- **Proactive Protection**: This feature helps prevent scams before they can affect your community members, even if no moderators are actively monitoring the group.

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and the Telegram ID of the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any sensitive information about the group it is added to.

<Tip>

The ChainPatrol Telegram bot is like any group user. You can adjust permissions
according to your group's needs.

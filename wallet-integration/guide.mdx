<Note>

This guide assumes you're creating a wallet using a web browser extension, but the same principles apply
to integrate our APIs for Mobile or Desktop wallets.

[Let us know](mailto:nikita@chainpatrol.io) if you'd like to see a guide for a specific
use-case that's not covered here.

</Note>

## Overview

The goal of integrating ChainPatrol's API into your wallet is to prevent users from interacting
with a malicious website that is intended to steal their funds or credentials.

To achieve this goal, you will need to do the following:

- 🔍 Detect when a user has visited a new website
- 🥷 Check if the website is malicious with the ChainPatrol API
- ⚠️ Display a warning to the user if the website is malicious
- 🤞 Allow the user to continue if they wish
- 😅 Allow the user to report a false positive

Let's dive deeper into each of these steps:

## Detecting a new website

The first step is to detect when a user has visited a new website. If you're building a
web browser extension, you can use the `browser.onBeforeNavigate` API. Here
we're using Mozilla's [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill)
to smooth out the differences between the Chrome and Firefox APIs.

```ts
import browser from "webextension-polyfill";

browser.webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate.addListener(async function (details) {
  //do stuff
});
```

This code would typically go into your `Background` file.

## Checking if the website is malicious

Once we know the user has visited a new website, we can check if the website is malicious
with the ChainPatrol API.

```ts
// check if a URL is blocked
export const checkUrl = async (url: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://app.chainpatrol.io/api/v2/asset/check",
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-API-KEY": "YOUR API KEY",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ type: "URL", content: url }),
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();

  return data.status === "BLOCKED";
};
```

## Displaying a warning to the user

If the website is malicious, you should display a warning to the user.

Our recommended approach is to redirect the user to a warning page which will let the
user know that they are about to visit a malicious website, and give them the option to
safely exit, continue, or report a false positive if they believe the website is not malicious.

```ts
browser.webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate.addListener(async function (details) {
  const isBlocked = await checkUrl(details.url);
  if (isBlocked) {
    // redirect
    browser.tabs.update(details.tabId, {
      url: "https://app.chainpatrol.io/warning?originUrl=" + details.url,
    });
  }
});
```

There are two options for creating the warning page:

The ChainPatrol hosted page takes care of:

- Displaying a warning to the user
- Allowing the user to continue if they wish
- Allowing the user to report a false positive

### Using the warning page

When you have determined that the site is malicious, you can redirect the tab to the ChainPatrol warning page. You need to pass the `originUrl` query parameter to the warning page so that it can display the URL to the user.

```ts
browser.webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate.addListener(async function (details) {
  const isBlocked = await checkUrl(details.url);
  if (isBlocked) {
    // redirect
    browser.tabs.update(details.tabId, {
      url: `https://app.chainpatrol.io/warning?originUrl=${details.url}`,
    });
  }
});
```

### Allowing the user to Continue

To allow the user to ignore the warning and continue to the potentially malicious site, listen for the `CHAINPATROL_CONTINUE_AT_OWN_RISK` message in your background script
and add the domain to a list of domains to ignore.

```ts
// In your extension's background script
browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.type === "CHAINPATROL_CONTINUE_AT_OWN_RISK") {
    addToIgnoreList(request.domain);
  }
});
```

Then you can update your code to first check if the URL is in the ignore list before checking if it's blocked:

```ts
browser.webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate.addListener(async function (details) {
  if (checkIgnoreList(details.url)) {
    return;
  }

  // ...existing code for checking if the URL is blocked
});
```

<Note>
  It's up to you how you want to store this data, but we recommended using the
  browser's storage APIs, such as:
  [chrome.storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/)
  for Chrome extensions.
</Note>

### Whitelabeling the warning page

If you want to customize the look and feel of the warning page, [reach out to us](mailto:nikita@chainpatrol.io?subject=Whitelabelling%20warning%20page&body=)
and we can work with you to create a custom branded warning page with your logo and colors.

## Custom Page

### Displaying the warning

We can display the warning by reading the `originUrl` query parameter:

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const originUrl = urlParams.get("originUrl");
```

and displaying it on the page.

```html
<h1>Warning</h1>
<p>
  You are about to visit a website that has been flagged as malicious by
  ChainPatrol.
</p>
<p><strong>Origin URL:</strong> {{ originUrl }}</p>
```

### Allowing the user to Continue

If the user wishes to continue, we can allow them to do so by adding a button to the warning page that will redirect them
back to the original website

```html
<a href="{{ originUrl }}">Continue at your own risk</a>
```

<Note>
  To prevent the user from seeing the warning again, we can add the domain to a
  list of domains to ignore. It's up to you how you want to store this data, but
  we recommended using the browser's storage APIs or equivalent on other
  platforms.
</Note>

#### Allowing the user to report a false positive

If the user believes the website is not malicious, we can allow them to report a false positive
by adding a button to the warning page that will redirect them to the [ChainPatrol dispute page](https://app.chainpatrol.io/dispute).

```html
<a href="https://app.chainpatrol.io/dispute?content={{ originUrl }}">
  Report a false positive
</a>
```

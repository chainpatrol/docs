## Assets

On ChainPatrol, we track crypto-related items like URLs, contract addresses, and wallet addresses.
These items are called **assets**. Assets can be added to the ChainPatrol database by organization owners.
Typically, we'll add the assets for you during your onboarding process.

### Asset Status

Each asset has a status that indicates whether or not it is allowed or blocked:

- **Allowed** - The asset is safe and has been reviewed by the owner of the asset and ChainPatrol.
- **Blocked** - The asset is a scam and has been reported to ChainPatrol.

If the asset has not been reviewed by ChainPatrol, it will have the following status:

- **Unknown** - The asset has not been reviewed by ChainPatrol.

## Detections

Detections are potential malicious activities that have been automatically identified by our system. Our automated detection system continuously monitors various platforms and networks to identify potential threats and suspicious activities related to your assets.

## Reports

Reports are submissions of potential scams or threats made by users or automated systems. They are the way that users can change the status of an asset. When a user reports an asset, they submit one or more proposals that contain a request to change the asset status.

Reports can be submitted either by the org members through the organization's admin dashboard, or by the public through the organization's public security portal.

### Report Status

Each report has a status that indicates whether or not it has been reviewed by the organization owner and ChainPatrol:

- **To Do**: None of the proposals in the report have been reviewed yet
- **In Progress**: Some of the proposals in the report have been reviewed
- **Closed**: All of the proposals in the report have been reviewed

Reports are grouped by their status in the admin dashboard to make it easier to manage.

For more information about how to create reports, see the [Report stage](/reporting-flow/report) page.

## Proposals & Asset Scans

Proposals are the way that users can propose changes the status of an asset. When a user submits a report, they are actually submitting one or more proposals. Typically, a scam will have multiple URLs and contract addresses associated with it, so you can submit a report with separate proposals for each with some context about why you think it's a scam in the description.

Asset scans are the way that we automatically identify potential threats and suspicious activities related to your assets.

## Reviews

Org admins and ChainPatrol staff **both** have to review a proposal to change the status of an asset. When a proposal is reviewed, the reviewer can either approve or reject the proposal. If the proposal is approved by both the org admin and ChainPatrol, the asset status will be updated. If the proposal is rejected by either the org admin or ChainPatrol, the asset status will not be updated, and the proposal will be closed.

For more information about how to review proposals, see the [Review stage](/reporting-flow/review) page.

## Takedowns

Takedowns are requests submitted to remove malicious content from various platforms. When malicious content is identified and confirmed, ChainPatrol can initiate takedown requests to have the content removed.

### Takedown Status

Takedowns can have two main states:

- **To Do**: The takedown request is to be created. This is the initial state once we have confirmed malicious content.
- **In Progress**: The takedown request has been submitted to the platform. ie. We have emailed a hosting provider to remove the malicious content and are waiting for them to respond.
- **Completed**: Successfully removed malicious content based on our takedown requests

The takedown process helps ensure that confirmed malicious content is removed from platforms, reducing the potential impact on users.


### Takedown Tasks

Each Takedown is broken down into one or more **Takedown Tasks**, which represent individual takedown actions at different provider levels. The task types depend on the asset: for URLs/pages, tasks are created for the **hosting provider**, **domain registrar**, and/or **TLD registrar** (whichever are detected); for platform-specific assets like Twitter, Telegram, or Medium, platform-specific task types are created instead.

Each task progresses through its own lifecycle with statuses: todo → submitted → approved (or rejected / stale / cancelled). Tasks also carry a `retractionStatus` for cases where a takedown needs to be reversed. Tasks can be completed manually by staff or auto-completed when automated liveness checks detect the asset is down at a specific provider level.

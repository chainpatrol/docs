title: How it works
---

For Web3 project operators, ChainPatrol provides a security portal that allows you to monitor 
your community for malicious activity. The security portal provides a dashboard that shows you
the latest scams targeting your community. You can also whitelist your own links and addresses 
to prevent false positives.

For wallets and security apps, ChainPatrol provides a allow/blocklist of malicious URLs, contract 
addresses, and wallet addresses through our free API.

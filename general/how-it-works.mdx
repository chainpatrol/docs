### Why ChainPatrol

ChainPatrol combines automated detection, AI‑assisted analysis, and human review to protect brands and users from phishing and abuse — across 50+ platforms — and pushes block decisions to the places your users actually are (wallets, browsers, DNS resolvers, hosting providers).

Fast path to protection: suspicious content is detected, analyzed, reviewed, and when confirmed as a threat, protection is deployed across all major platforms within seconds to minutes.

## 1) How threats enter the system

- **Human reports (web & Slack)**

  - Your team can submit suspicious URLs, addresses, and profiles through our web interface or directly from Slack
  - We verify submissions and provide instant feedback if content is already being monitored
  - Each submission becomes a report for our team to review

- **Automated detection (50+ platforms)**
  - We continuously scan major platforms (Google, YouTube, Twitter, app stores, Telegram, TikTok, and Web3 sources) for threats targeting your brand
  - When we find suspicious content, we automatically create reports for review

## 2) Content processing

- We analyze and categorize all submitted content (URLs, addresses, social profiles, etc.) into our threat database
- We identify relationships between different pieces of content to build a complete picture of threats
- Duplicate submissions are automatically merged to avoid redundant work
- Invalid or inappropriate submissions are filtered out automatically

## 3) Report creation and tracking

- Each threat becomes a report that our team reviews and tracks through completion
- Reports include all relevant evidence (screenshots, metadata, related content)
- You can see the status of all reports in your dashboard (Pending → In Review → Completed)
- Reports are processed immediately, even for automatically detected threats

## 4) Threat analysis

- We gather additional information about each threat (website content, domain details, social media activity, etc.)
- Our AI analyzes the content to determine threat type (phishing, brand impersonation, etc.) and confidence level
- We set custom threat thresholds for your organization to match your risk tolerance
- We automatically discover and analyze related threats to build a complete threat picture

## 5) Block decisions

- When we confirm a threat, we immediately update our blocklist and begin the process of protecting your users
- This decision triggers automatic distribution to all our partner platforms and services

## 6) Protection distribution

- **Public blocklist**
  - We maintain a public list of blocked threats that any service can use
- **Direct integration with major platforms**
  - MetaMask wallet protection
  - Google Safe Browsing
  - Community security lists
  - DNS resolvers like Quad9
- All updates are safe and tested before going live

## 7) Protection verification

- We continuously monitor that our blocks are active across all partner platforms
- You can see exactly where your threats are being blocked and how quickly protection was deployed
- This gives you confidence that your users are protected everywhere they go

## 8) Automated takedowns

- We automatically request takedowns from hosting providers, domain registrars, and social platforms
- We work with major providers including Cloudflare, Vercel, GoDaddy, Squarespace, Firebase, and many others
- For social platforms like Telegram and Twitter, we use automated reporting systems
- We track takedown progress and avoid duplicate requests

## 9) Executive reporting

- We generate clear, executive-ready reports showing threats detected and actions taken
- Reports use plain language suitable for sharing with stakeholders and management
- You can customize reporting frequency and content to match your needs

## 10) 24/7 infrastructure

- Our systems run continuously with automatic failover and redundancy
- We use rate limiting and security measures to protect against abuse
- All actions are logged and auditable for compliance and transparency
- We maintain strict security standards for all data and operations

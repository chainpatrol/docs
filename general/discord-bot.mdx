If you have a **Discord server**, you can use the [ChainPatrol Discord bot](https://chainpatrol.io/bot)
to let your server members submit scam reports to **ChainPatrol**. The bot will generate new
reports that get sent to your admin dashboard for review.

## Setup

<Tip>
  If you have a dedicated `scam-reports` channel, we recommend pinning a message
  in this channel and directing your server members to use the bot there for
  easy reporting
</Tip>

### Install the bot

To add the bot to your server, you need to be an admin of the server. Then, you
can use the following link to add the bot:

[🚀 Add ChainPatrol to your server](https://chainpatrol.io/bot/install)

Next, you need to configure the bot to send reports to your admin dashboard on ChainPatrol. Right now,
this is can be done by reaching out to us on our [Discord server](https://chainpatrol.io/discord)
and letting us know that you want to add the bot to your server. We will create an organization
for you on ChainPatrol and you can then use the `/setup connect` slash command to link your Discord server
to your org on ChainPatrol.

To check that the bot is working, you can use the `/setup status` command to see if the bot is
connected to your ChainPatrol organization.

### Feed

You can create a feed channel of all reports to your organization. To do this,
create a new channel on your Discord server and name it something like `chainpatrol-reports`. This is where the
bot will post messages when a new scam report is submitted.

Then, you can use the following command to link the channel to your ChainPatrol organization:

```
/setup feed <channel>
```

Follow the instructions in the bot's response to link the channel to your ChainPatrol organization.

You can check that the feed is connected correctly by running the `/setup status` command. If the
feed is connected correctly, you should see the channel name in the bot's response.

As a final test, you can try submitting a test scam report using the `/report` command. You should see a message
in the feed channel with the scam report shortly after submitting.

## Usage

Once the bot is added to your server, you can use the following commands:

- `/report <url>` - Submit a scam report for the given URL
- `/check <url>` - Check if the given URL is a scam

## Example

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know in our
[Discord server](https://chainpatrol.io/discord).

## Privacy

The bot does not collect any personal information. It only collects the URL and
the Discord ID for the user that submitted the report (in case a moderator needs
more information about why the URL is a scam). The bot does not store any information
about the server it is added to.

description: This article explains our strategy for dealing with false positives.

## Overview

At **ChainPatrol**, we take false positives very seriously. We've seen many projects try to build
fully automated systems that are supposed to be 100% accurate, or systems that rely completely
on crowd-sourced data, but we've never seen this work out well. Either the system flags too much
data as suspicious, or it flags too little. Either the system is too slow to be useful, or it's
too fast to be accurate.

> Remember the golden rule: **"Garbage in, garbage out."**

### Human in the loop

We believe that the only way to build a system that is both accurate and useful, is to have a human
in the loop. To that end, we have a team of analysts that review every single report submitted to our platform
whether its coming from a Web3 project owner, an automated scan, or from community submission.

**An asset will only end up as Blocked in our API if it has been reviewed by a human on our team, or
if it has been reviewed by a human working for one of our scanning partners.**

That said, accidents can happen. We're human too, and we make mistakes. If you believe that we've made a mistake,
please let us know by submitting a dispute.

## Report a false positive

You can report a false positive in our API by submitting a dispute at https://app.chainpatrol.io/dispute.
We will review your dispute as soon as possible, and take the appropriate action.

If there's a legal issue involved, you can reach us directly at [nikita@chainpatrol.io](mailto:nikita@chainpatrol.io).

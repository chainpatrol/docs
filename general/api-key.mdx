## Getting Your API Key

To access ChainPatrol's APIs and services, you'll need an API key. Here's how to get one:

1. Go to your [Organization Dashboard](https://app.chainpatrol.io/admin)
2. Navigate to the organization's `settings` page
3. Navigate to `API keys`
4. Click on `Create Key` and pick your settings

## Types of API Keys

### Organization vs User Keys

- **Organization Keys**: Grant organization-level attribution

  - Reports submitted with organization keys are attributed to a machine user
  - Best for automated systems, integrations, and organization-level workflows
  - Ideal for bots, automated reporting systems, and CI/CD pipelines

- **User Keys**: Grant user-level attribution
  - Reports submitted with user keys are attributed directly to your user account
  - Best for personal use and when individual accountability is needed
  - Ideal for manual reporting and personal tooling

### Test vs Live Keys

ChainPatrol provides both test and live environments to help you develop and test your integration safely.

- **Test Keys**: For distinguishing when being used in development and testing

  - Use in development environments
  - **These keys still affect production data**

- **Live Keys**: For production use
  - Use in production environments
  - Affects real data and reports
  - Required for actual threat detection and reporting

## API Key Format

ChainPatrol API keys follow this format:

- Always start with the prefix `cp_`
- Are unique to your organization
- Should be kept secure and not shared publicly

## Using Your API Key

When making API requests to ChainPatrol, include your API key in the request headers:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://app.chainpatrol.io/api/v2/asset/check", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: "URL",
    content: "example.com",
  }),
});
```

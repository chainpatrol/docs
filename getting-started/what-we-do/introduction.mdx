## Overview

In the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape, malicious actors are constantly targeting crypto users through sophisticated phishing attacks, fake domains, and social media impersonation. These threats not only put your community's assets at risk but can also severely damage your brand's reputation and erode user trust.

## Enterprise-Grade Protection for Leading Web3 Organizations

Today, ChainPatrol serves as the trusted security partner for some of the most prominent names in the blockchain industry, including Consensys, Sui, Arbitrum, ZkSync, Curve Finance, Starknet, and Polymarket.

These organizations rely on us to safeguard their communities from online impersonation and phishing attacks 24/7.

## Real-Time Protection Through Wallet Integration

At the core of our solution is a **continuously updated blocklist** of malicious domains, directly integrated into leading crypto wallets.

**Protected Wallets:** MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, and many more leading wallets

When users attempt to interact with a flagged malicious site, they receive an immediate warning, preventing potential losses before they happen. This proactive approach provides an essential layer of security that protects users at the point of transaction.

## Comprehensive Detection and Rapid Response

Our advanced detection system continuously monitors the digital landscape to identify scams impersonating your company across multiple channels:

- **Domains** - We scan for lookalike domains and phishing sites using your brand
- **Twitter/X** - Automated monitoring for fake accounts impersonating your official channels
- **Discord** - Detection of malicious servers and impersonator accounts targeting your community
- **Other Social Platforms** - Comprehensive coverage across the social media ecosystem

### Our Three-Step Response Process

When a threat is detected, our response is swift and decisive:

1. **Immediate Protection** - Malicious sites are blocked across our Wallet Network within minutes of detection, preventing your users from interacting with them
2. **Complete Takedown** - We don't stop at blocking. Our team proceeds with full takedown procedures, working to permanently remove fraudulent domains and social media accounts
3. **Ongoing Monitoring** - Continuous surveillance ensures new threats are identified and neutralized as they emerge

## The Cost of Inaction

<Warning>
Every day that phishing attacks go unaddressed, your community members are at risk of losing funds, and your brand reputation suffers.
</Warning>

Traditional security measures often react too slowly, allowing scammers to victimize multiple users before threats are contained.

## Key Takeaways

- Wallet integration provides point-of-transaction protection: Unlike email security or website warnings that users might miss, wallet integrations prevent interactions with malicious sites at the moment of connection
- Blocklist-first approach eliminates the waiting game: Users are protected within minutes through blocklist distribution while takedown requests work through slower provider channels
- Multi-channel monitoring catches threats early: Attackers spread campaigns across domains, social media, and ads simultaneously, so protection requires monitoring all channels at once
- Community protection multiplies individual security: When one organization's threat is blocked, all wallet users benefit from the updated blocklist regardless of which brand was targeted

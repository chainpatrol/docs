## Takedown Lifecycle

Every takedown follows a clear lifecycle inside ChainPatrol:

<Steps>
  <Step title="TODO" icon="circle">
    A takedown has been created and is waiting to be processed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="IN PROGRESS" icon="spinner">
    ChainPatrol is actively working on the takedown (submitting it to the appropriate provider and monitoring the request)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="COMPLETED" icon="circle-check">
    The provider removed the harmful content
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Alternative Outcomes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CANCELED" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    The takedown was stopped (e.g., content turned out to be invalid or unnecessary)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="PENDING RETRACTION" icon="clock" color="#f59e0b">
    Identified as false positive, marked for retraction but not yet sent to provider
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="RETRACTION SENT" icon="paper-plane" color="#8b5cf6">
    Formal retraction request submitted to provider to halt or reverse the takedown
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="RETRACTED" icon="rotate-left" color="#10b981">
    Provider confirmed retraction—takedown fully stopped or reversed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How ChainPatrol Processes a Takedown

### Creation of a Takedown

<Info>
A takedown is automatically created for every asset that is blocked, provided that the organization has the **Takedowns service enabled**.
</Info>

Each takedown is directly linked to the blocked asset and contains all essential context required for further action:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Asset Reference" icon="link">
    URL, social profile, IPFS hash, or app listing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Supporting Evidence" icon="file-lines">
    Explanation of why the asset was classified as harmful
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Provider Information" icon="server">
    Platform or host responsible for the content
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

After creation, the takedown is placed into the **TODO** state, indicating that it has been generated and is ready to be reviewed and processed.

### Assigning a Provider

ChainPatrol determines which platform, hosting company, registrar, or channel is responsible for the content.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hosting & Domains" icon="server">
    - Hosting providers (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.)
    - Domain registrars (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
    - **TLD registrars** (for top-level domains like `.com`, `.xyz`, etc.)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Social Media" icon="share-nodes">
    - Twitter/X
    - Facebook
    - Instagram
    - YouTube
    - **Telegram**
    - Discord
    - Reddit
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="App Stores" icon="mobile">
    - Google Play Store
    - Apple App Store
    - Browser extension marketplaces
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Distributed Storage" icon="database">
    - **IPFS** gateways and pinning services
    - Decentralized hosting platforms
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
We maintain an up-to-date record of **100+ abuse contacts** for both submission of takedowns and retraction of requests made in error.
</Note>

### Submitting the Takedown

ChainPatrol prepares and submits the takedown request to the appropriate provider responsible for hosting or distributing the malicious content.

**What's Included in a Submission:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clear Explanation" icon="file-lines">
    Detailed description of why the content is considered harmful, including evidence and context
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Legal Documentation" icon="scale-balanced">
    Supporting legal documents required to justify the removal (when applicable)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provider-Specific Format" icon="envelope">
    Submissions use each provider's preferred reporting channel to ensure highest likelihood of success
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Once submitted, the takedown transitions into the **IN PROGRESS** state.

<Check>
**Full Transparency:** Customers have real-time visibility including status updates and provider responses. Copies of provider communications are surfaced directly in the takedown events timeline.
</Check>

### Monitoring

After submission, ChainPatrol continuously monitors the takedown to track its progress and outcome:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Content Verification" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Verifying whether targeted content has been removed
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Provider Responses" icon="messages">
    Reviewing and interpreting responses from the provider
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Escalation" icon="arrow-up">
    Automatically retrying or escalating when needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
The takedown remains active until a final outcome is reached. Continuous monitoring ensures takedowns are not prematurely closed.
</Tip>

### Final Outcome

A takedown ends in one of the following states:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="COMPLETED" icon="circle-check">
    **The provider removed the content.**
    
    Examples include:
    - Websites becoming inaccessible
    - Social media profiles or messages being removed
    - Telegram channels being shut down
    - IPFS content becoming unavailable via gateways
    - Scam apps being delisted
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CANCELED" icon="circle-xmark">
    **The takedown request cannot proceed.**
    
    Reasons include:
    - Invalid content
    - Missing required documentation
    - Asset no longer meets takedown criteria
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="RETRACTED" icon="rotate-left">
    **The takedown was formally withdrawn after submission.**
    
    Typically because:
    - Asset identified as false positive
    - Content determined to be legitimate
    - Organization requested retraction
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
All outcomes are logged clearly and shown to customers for transparency.
</Info>

## Takedown Retraction

A **takedown retraction** is the formal process of stopping or reversing a takedown request after it has already been submitted to a provider.

<Warning>
Retractions ensure that legitimate content is not removed incorrectly and that providers are notified as quickly as possible when an issue is identified.
</Warning>

### When Retractions Occur

A retraction is typically initiated when ChainPatrol determines that the original takedown was created in error:

- **False Positive** - Asset was incorrectly classified as harmful
- **Legitimate Content** - Further investigation shows content is authorized
- **Customer Request** - Organization identifies the asset as legitimate

### Retraction Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identification">
    Asset is identified as legitimate or false positive
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="PENDING RETRACTION">
    Takedown marked for retraction but request not yet sent
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="RETRACTION SENT">
    Formal request submitted to provider to halt or reverse the takedown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="RETRACTED">
    Provider confirms—takedown stopped or reversed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Takedown retractions are handled with the same level of care, structure, and transparency as takedown submissions.
</Note>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if my takedown was successful?" icon="circle-question">
    The takedown will move to the **COMPLETED** state, and you'll see confirmation from the provider in the takedown timeline.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did my takedown take longer than expected?" icon="clock">
    Response times vary across platforms. Some act quickly, while others require legal documentation or take several days to respond. Hosting providers typically respond within 4-48 hours, while domain registrars may take 24-72 hours or longer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if the content appears again?" icon="rotate">
    If previously removed content reappears, the existing takedown is **reactivated** by returning to the **TODO** state. ChainPatrol will then act on it again, re-filing requests until the content is completely taken down.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can ChainPatrol guarantee removal?" icon="shield-check">
    No provider guarantees removal in all cases, but ChainPatrol works to maximize success through consistent, accurate submissions and continuous monitoring. Our success rates vary by provider but are typically very high for legitimate threats.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What documentation do I need to provide?" icon="file-lines">
    Most takedowns require legal documents such as:
    - Letter of Authorization
    - Power of Attorney
    - Trademark registration

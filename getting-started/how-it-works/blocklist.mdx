ChainPatrol's Blocklist is a real-time, community-powered database of confirmed phishing sites, scams, and malicious assets that protects users across the web3 ecosystem.

## What is the ChainPatrol Blocklist?

The ChainPatrol Blocklist is a continuously updated list of **350,000+ malicious websites**, social media accounts, and blockchain addresses that have been confirmed as threats through our expert review process. When an asset is added to the blocklist, it's automatically distributed to our network of security integrations to protect users in real-time.

## How Assets Get Blocklisted

Assets are added to the blocklist through a rigorous review process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detection">
    Potential threats are identified through automated detection, community reports, or partner submissions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analysis">
    Our AI-powered scanning engine analyzes assets using 50+ detection rules
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review">
    A BLOCK proposal is created and reviewed by our security team
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approval">
    After review approval, the asset status changes to BLOCKED
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Distribution">
    The blocked asset is automatically submitted to our integration partners
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Only assets that pass through this review and approval process are added to the blocklist.
</Note>

## Blocklist Distribution

When an asset is blocklisted, it's automatically distributed to multiple platforms:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google Safe Browsing" icon="chrome">
    All asset types eligible for browser protection
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SEAL-ISAC" icon="users">
    URLs hosted on 50+ hosting providers (Vercel, Cloudflare, AWS, etc.)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Crypto-ISAC" icon="bitcoin">
    All URL and domain assets
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Eth-Phishing-Detect" icon="ethereum">
    Ethereum-related phishing sites
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Polkadot Phishing" icon="link">
    Cross-network phishing domains
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Direct Partners" icon="plug">
    Real-time API updates to wallet providers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Distribution happens automatically through our integration workflows. There's no manual step required.
</Info>

<Tip>
In the case of a false positive, we will submit retraction requests for ChainPatrol's submissions to these partners.
</Tip>

## Why Distribution Matters

Traditional cybersecurity relies on **takedowns** — requesting hosting providers or domain registrars to remove malicious content.

### Traditional Takedown Timeline

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hosting Provider" icon="server">
    4-48 hours for takedown
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Domain Registrar" icon="globe">
    24-72 hours for takedown
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="No Response" icon="circle-xmark">
    Some providers never respond
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### ChainPatrol's Blocklist Approach

ChainPatrol provides **immediate protection** by:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Browser & Wallet Blocking" icon="shield">
    Block access at the browser and wallet level
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Always-On Protection" icon="shield-check">
    Protect users even if the site remains online
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Universal Coverage" icon="globe">
    Works across all hosting providers and jurisdictions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="15-30 Minute Response" icon="bolt">
    Users protected in minutes, not days
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Check>
This **"blocklist-first, takedown-second"** approach means users are protected within minutes, not days.

## Why AI-Powered Protection Matters

In Web3, threats move fast. Phishing sites can be spun up in minutes, targeting your community before traditional security measures can respond. That's why we built an AI-first detection engine—one that identifies and neutralizes threats **within seconds**, not hours.

<Info>
Our approach combines the speed of automation with the precision of human expertise, ensuring your brand stays protected around the clock.

## The ChainPatrol Detection Mix

We've engineered the optimal balance between speed and accuracy:

| Detection Type | How It Works |
| --- | --- |
| **Fully Automated** (44.74%) | Threats that meet all AI confidence thresholds are blocked instantly |
| **AI + Human Review** (55.26%) | Edge cases are flagged for immediate analyst review |

<Note>
**Why this matters:** Multiple AI and rule-based thresholds must pass before any action is taken. This layered approach prevents false positives while ensuring legitimate threats are caught quickly.
</Note>

## Our AI Technology Stack

ChainPatrol uses a multi-model approach, combining the best AI technologies for comprehensive threat detection.

- **Large Language Models** - Advanced text and content analysis
- **Visual & Structural Analysis** - Screenshot comparison and DOM analysis
- **Custom-Trained Models** - Specialized Web3 threat detection
- **Decision Engine** - Multi-model score aggregation

### 1. Large Language Models

We leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for content analysis:

**OpenAI GPT-4** - Analyzes text content, social media posts, and communications to identify phishing language patterns and scam indicators

**Gemini 2.0** - Enables multi-modal analysis, processing both text and visual content simultaneously for faster, more accurate detection

### 2. Visual & Structural Analysis

Phishing sites often look identical to legitimate ones. Our visual AI catches them:

1. **Visual Similarity Detection** - Compares screenshots against your legitimate sites to catch pixel-perfect impersonation attempts
2. **Structural Analysis** - Examines DOM structure, code patterns, and page layouts to identify known phishing templates—even when visuals differ
3. **URLScan Integration** - Real-time visual and structural scanning of suspicious URLs

### 3. Custom-Trained Models

Our models are tuned specifically for Web3 threats:

- Trained on **500,000+ real threat examples** from across the ecosystem
- Continuously updated with new attack patterns
- Fine-tuned for Web3-specific threats like wallet drainers, fake airdrops, and impersonation scams

## How Detection Works

Here's what happens when a potential threat is identified:

1. **Discovery** - Our engine monitors 50+ platforms 24/7
2. **Analysis** - Multiple AI models analyze the threat independently
3. **Scoring** - Our decision engine aggregates confidence scores
4. **Action** - High-confidence threats are blocked; edge cases go to analysts
5. **Distribution** - Confirmed threats are pushed to all integrated platforms

### The Decision Engine

At the core of our system is a proprietary decision engine that:

- **Model Aggregation** - Aggregates outputs from all AI models
- **Weighted Scoring** - Applies confidence-based scoring
- **Cross-Reference** - Checks against known threat databases
- **Fast Decisions** - Makes final disposition in milliseconds

<Tip>
**No single point of failure:** A threat must pass multiple independent checks before being actioned, ensuring accuracy while maintaining speed.
</Tip>

## Real-Time Threat Distribution

When our AI detects a threat, it doesn't just sit in a database. We push it directly to the platforms your users rely on:

### Browser Protection

**Google Safe Browsing** - Integration means threats are blocked in Chrome, Edge, and Safari—reaching billions of users. We maintain a **68.32% acceptance rate**, among the highest in the industry.

### Wallet Protection

Direct API integrations with leading wallets provide real-time warnings:

- **MetaMask** - Core integration partner
- **Phantom** - Direct API for Solana ecosystem
- **WalletConnect** - Real-time threat API
- **20+ More Wallets** - Ecosystem-wide protection

### Infrastructure Partners

- **Cloudflare** - Direct threat reporting for faster takedowns
- **Polymarket** - Moderation API integration

**The result:** Threats detected by ChainPatrol can be blocked across the entire Web3 ecosystem within seconds.

## Continuous Learning & Improvement

Our AI gets smarter every day through:

**Human-in-the-Loop Training** - Every analyst decision feeds back into our models. When our team reviews edge cases, that knowledge improves future detection accuracy.

**Threat Intelligence Networks** - We're core contributors to Eth-Phishing-Detect with elevated permissions, and active members of SEAL-ISAC. This gives us early access to emerging threats and allows us to share our detections with the broader security community.

**Expanding Datasets** - Our threat database grows daily with new examples, ensuring our models stay ahead of evolving attack techniques.

## Why AI-Powered Protection Matters

In Web3, threats move fast. Phishing sites can be spun up in minutes, targeting your community before traditional security measures can respond. That's why we built an AI-first detection engine—one that identifies and neutralizes threats **within seconds**, not hours.

<Info>
Our approach combines the speed of automation with the precision of human expertise, ensuring your brand stays protected around the clock.
</Info>

## The ChainPatrol Detection Mix

We've engineered the optimal balance between speed and accuracy:

| Detection Type | How It Works |
| --- | --- |
| **Fully Automated** (44.74%) | Threats that meet all AI confidence thresholds are blocked instantly |
| **AI + Human Review** (55.26%) | Edge cases are flagged for immediate analyst review |

<Note>
**Why this matters:** Multiple AI and rule-based thresholds must pass before any action is taken. This layered approach prevents false positives while ensuring legitimate threats are caught quickly.
</Note>

## Our AI Technology Stack

ChainPatrol uses a multi-model approach, combining the best AI technologies for comprehensive threat detection.

### 1. Large Language Models

We leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for content analysis:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenAI GPT-4" icon="openai">
    Analyzes text content, social media posts, and communications to identify phishing language patterns and scam indicators
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gemini 2.0" icon="google">
    Enables multi-modal analysis, processing both text and visual content simultaneously for faster, more accurate detection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Visual & Structural Analysis

Phishing sites often look identical to legitimate ones. Our visual AI catches them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visual Similarity Detection">
    Compares screenshots against your legitimate sites to catch pixel-perfect impersonation attempts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Structural Analysis">
    Examines DOM structure, code patterns, and page layouts to identify known phishing templates—even when visuals differ
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="URLScan Integration">
    Real-time visual and structural scanning of suspicious URLs
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Custom-Trained Models

Our models are tuned specifically for Web3 threats:

- Trained on **500,000+ real threat examples** from across the ecosystem
- Continuously updated with new attack patterns
- Fine-tuned for Web3-specific threats like wallet drainers, fake airdrops, and impersonation scams

## How Detection Works

Here's what happens when a potential threat is identified:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery">
    Our engine monitors 50+ platforms 24/7
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analysis">
    Multiple AI models analyze the threat independently
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scoring">
    Our decision engine aggregates confidence scores
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action">
    High-confidence threats are blocked; edge cases go to analysts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Distribution">
    Confirmed threats are pushed to all integrated platforms
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Decision Engine

At the core of our system is a proprietary decision engine that:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Model Aggregation" icon="layer-group">
    Aggregates outputs from all AI models
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Weighted Scoring" icon="scale-balanced">
    Applies confidence-based scoring
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cross-Reference" icon="database">
    Checks against known threat databases
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fast Decisions" icon="bolt">
    Makes final disposition in milliseconds
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**No single point of failure:** A threat must pass multiple independent checks before being actioned, ensuring accuracy while maintaining speed.

## Overview

In Web3, threats move fast. Phishing sites can be spun up in minutes, targeting your community before traditional security measures can respond. That's why we built an AI-first detection engine—one that identifies and neutralizes threats **within seconds**, not hours.

<Info>
Our approach combines the speed of automation with the precision of human expertise, ensuring your brand stays protected around the clock.

## The ChainPatrol Detection Mix

We've engineered the optimal balance between speed and accuracy:

| Detection Type | How It Works |
| --- | --- |
| **Fully Automated**  | Threats that meet all AI confidence thresholds are blocked instantly |
| **Human Review**  | Edge cases are flagged for immediate analyst review |

<Note>
**Why this matters:** Multiple AI and rule-based thresholds must pass before any action is taken. This layered approach prevents false positives while ensuring legitimate threats are caught quickly.
</Note>

## How Our AI Detects Threats

ChainPatrol uses a multi-layered AI approach, combining multiple detection methods for comprehensive threat protection.

### Content Analysis

Our AI analyzes text content across platforms to identify threats:

- **Language Pattern Detection** - Identifies phishing language, scam indicators, and social engineering tactics in posts, messages, and web content
- **Context Understanding** - Recognizes subtle impersonation attempts and fraudulent claims that might fool traditional filters
- **Multi-Platform Monitoring** - Analyzes content across social media, websites, messaging apps, and more

### Visual Detection

Phishing sites often look identical to legitimate ones. Our visual AI catches them:

- **Visual Similarity Analysis** - Compares page appearance against your legitimate sites to catch pixel-perfect impersonation attempts
- **Structural Pattern Matching** - Examines page structure, code patterns, and layouts to identify known phishing templates—even when visuals differ
- **Real-Time Scanning** - Continuously monitors suspicious URLs for visual indicators of threats

### Web3-Specialized Detection

Our models are trained specifically for Web3 threats:

- Trained on hundreds of thousands of real threat examples from across the ecosystem
- Continuously updated with new attack patterns as they emerge
- Fine-tuned for Web3-specific threats like wallet drainers, fake airdrops, and impersonation scams

## How Detection Works

Here's what happens when a potential threat is identified:

1. **Discovery** - Our engine monitors 50+ platforms 24/7
2. **Analysis** - Multiple AI models analyze the threat independently
3. **Scoring** - Our decision engine aggregates confidence scores
4. **Action** - High-confidence threats are blocked; edge cases go to analysts
5. **Distribution** - Confirmed threats are pushed to all integrated platforms

### The Decision Process

At the core of our system is a sophisticated decision engine that:

- **Multi-Signal Aggregation** - Combines outputs from all detection methods
- **Confidence-Based Scoring** - Weighs evidence to determine threat likelihood
- **Cross-Reference Validation** - Checks against known threat databases and patterns
- **Instant Decisions** - Makes final determinations in seconds

No single signal is enough on its own—multiple independent checks must pass before a threat is actioned, helping maintain accuracy while preserving speed.

## Real-Time Threat Distribution

When our AI detects a threat, it doesn't just sit in a database. We push it directly to the platforms your users rely on:

### Browser Protection

**Google Safe Browsing** - Our integration means threats are blocked in Chrome, Edge, and Safari—reaching billions of users worldwide.

### Wallet Protection

Direct integrations with leading wallets provide real-time warnings at the point of transaction:

- **MetaMask** - Core integration partner protecting millions of users

**The result:** Threats detected by ChainPatrol are blocked across the entire Web3 ecosystem within seconds.

## Continuous Learning & Improvement

Our AI gets smarter every day through:

**Human-in-the-Loop Training** - Every analyst decision feeds back into our AI. When our team reviews edge cases, that knowledge improves future detection accuracy.

**Threat Intelligence Networks** - We're active contributors to major threat intelligence communities, giving us early access to emerging threats and allowing us to share our detections with the broader security ecosystem.

**Expanding Datasets** - Our threat database grows daily with new examples, ensuring our AI stays ahead of evolving attack techniques.

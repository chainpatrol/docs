---

Detection sources are automated monitoring systems that continuously scan the internet for potential threats to your brand. Each source monitors a specific platform or data stream, searching for suspicious assets that may be impersonating your organization or attempting to defraud your users.

## How Detection Sources Work

Detection sources operate on automated schedules, running searches across various platforms using your organization's **included terms** (brand names, products, keywords you want to monitor) and **excluded terms** (legitimate domains you want to filter out). When a source finds a potential threat, it automatically submits the asset for analysis through ChainPatrol's threat detection pipeline.

### The Detection Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scheduled Execution">
    Each detection source runs on a predefined schedule (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly, daily)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Platform Scanning">
    The source searches its platform (ex. Twitter, Google Ads, Reddit) using your organization's keywords and monitoring rules
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Asset Discovery">
    Matching results are collected as potential threats
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Processing">
    Discovered assets are automatically submitted to the threat detection system
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enrichment & Analysis">
    Assets are scanned, enriched with additional data, and evaluated by the rules engine
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Threat Scoring">
    A threat score is calculated based on multiple detection rules
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action Taken">
    If the score exceeds your organization's detection thresholds, the threat can be automatically reported or flagged for review
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Source Configuration

Each detection source can be customized with:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Status Options" icon="toggle-on">
    Enable or disable sources
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Scope Settings" icon="layer-group">
    Organization or global level
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Schedule Configuration" icon="clock">
    Custom timing and frequency
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Status Options

- **Enabled** - Source runs automatically on schedule
- **Disabled** - Source does not run

### Scope Settings

Detection sources can operate at two levels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Organization Level">
    Uses your specific keywords and monitoring settings
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Global Level">
    Runs system-wide monitoring for all organizations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Schedule Configuration

Sources run on automated schedules that vary by:

- **Organization Priority** - Higher priority organizations get more frequent scans
- **Source Type** - Different sources have different default intervals based on their data freshness and rate limits

<Tip>
**Custom Schedules:** You can override default schedules with custom cron expressions for fine-tuned control over when each source runs.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Setting Up Detection Sources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with core sources">
    Enable search engines and social media sources first
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure included terms">
    Add all your brand names, product names, and common misspellings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set excluded terms">
    Add your legitimate domains to reduce false positives
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust thresholds">
    Set appropriate auto-reporting thresholds based on your risk tolerance
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor results">
    Review initial detections to fine-tune your configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Considerations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rate Limits" icon="gauge">
    Each detection source respects platform-specific rate limits. The system automatically handles rate limiting by:
    
    - Adjusting request timing
    - Batching operations where possible
    - Logging when limits are reached
    
    <Note>
    Rate limiting ensures compliance with platform APIs while maintaining consistent monitoring coverage.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Resource Usage" icon="server">
    Detection sources are optimized for efficiency:
    
    - Results are processed in batches to avoid overwhelming the system
    - Duplicate assets are automatically filtered out
    - Sources run in parallel when possible
    - Failed detections are logged but don't block other sources
    
    <Check>
    Our infrastructure is designed to handle high-volume monitoring without impacting detection speed or accuracy.

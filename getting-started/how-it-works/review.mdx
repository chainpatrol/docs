## Overview

In order to block malicious threats or allow official assets, we use the Review process. To change an Asset's status (from `UNKNOWN` to `BLOCKED`/`ALLOWED`, or in special cases between `BLOCKED` and `ALLOWED`), we create a **Proposal**.

<Info>
Each Proposal is evaluated by either human reviewers or our automation, who can make one of four decisions: **Approve**, **Reject**, **Skip**, or **Escalate**.
</Info>

### Proposal Decisions

- **Approve** - Accepts the Asset's status change and closes the Proposal
- **Reject** - Denies the status change and closes the Proposal
- **Skip** - Keeps Proposal pending when there's insufficient evidence
- **Escalate** - Sends to senior team members or customer for additional review

Only **Approve** and **Reject** decisions close out the Proposal. **Skip** and **Escalate** keep the Proposal in `PENDING` status for further evaluation.

## Automation

Our automated review system handles high-confidence threat detections, allowing human analysts to focus on edge cases and complex decisions.

### When Do We Perform Automated Review?

Automated review is enabled when specific conditions are met:

**Organization Requirements** - Reviewing automation only activates for organizations with an active subscription status (Active, Trial, or Prospect).

**Asset Information Requirements** - Automation requires sufficient data about the Asset. Some platforms currently lack adequate information gathering capabilities. Platforms requiring human review include Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok due to limited automated data collection.

**Proposal Type Restrictions** - Automated review only handles Proposals to set an Asset to `BLOCKED` status. Proposals to set Assets to `ALLOWED` or `UNKNOWN` status are not automated.

### How Does Automated Review Make a Decision?

Our automated review system calculates a **risk score** to determine whether an asset should be approved as malicious.

1. **Rule Execution** - During an Asset Scan, multiple detection rules are executed against the asset
2. **Score Calculation** - The risk score is a weighted sum of all individual scores from each successful rule execution
3. **Threshold Evaluation** - The final risk score is compared against our approval threshold (1.0)
4. **Decision** - Assets meeting the threshold are automatically approved; others are escalated

#### Risk Score Example

**High Risk (Auto-Approved):**
Asset has 10 rules executed. 6 rules contribute a score of 0.2 each (= 1.2 total), 4 rules contribute a score of 0.1 each (= 0.4 total). Total Risk Score: 1.6. Since 1.6 ≥ 1.0, the Proposal is automatically approved.

**Medium Risk (Escalated):**
Asset has 10 rules executed. 4 rules contribute a score of 0.1 each (= 0.4 total), 2 rules contribute a score of 0.2 each (= 0.4 total). Total Risk Score: 0.8. Since 0.8 < 1.0, the Proposal is escalated for human review.

### Legitimacy Rules

<Warning>
**Special Case:** Legitimacy Rules can override automatic approval, even with high risk scores.
</Warning>

Legitimacy Rules are special detection rules that identify when an asset is **not malicious**. If a Legitimacy Rule with "Very High" confidence passes, automation will **not** automatically approve the Proposal, regardless of the Risk Score.

**Example:** An asset might have a risk score of 1.5, but if it matches a Very High confidence Legitimacy Rule (e.g., verified official domain), the Proposal will be escalated for human review instead of being auto-blocked.

### Automatically Approving the Proposal

For a Proposal to be automatically approved, **all** of the following must be true:

**Required Conditions:**
- Asset must not already be `ALLOWED`
- Organization must have Reviewing enabled and not be inactive
- Proposal must be for blocking the Asset (not for allowing)
- No Legitimacy Rules of "Very High" confidence have passed

**Approval Triggers (at least one must be true):**
- **Option 1:** Risk Score ≥ 1.0 (the overall Risk Score of the Asset is at or above 1.0)
- **Option 2:** Trusted Reporter (the Asset was part of a Report created by a Trusted Reporter)

## Human Review

Humans are essential for making decisions about Proposals that fall outside automated approval criteria.

Since automation only handles Proposals to block Assets with a Risk Score ≥ 1.0, human analysts evaluate all other cases.

### When Humans Are Involved

- **Low Risk Blocks** - Proposals to Block an Asset with a Risk Score < 1.0
- **Allow Proposals** - All Proposals to Allow an Asset
- **Unknown Status** - Proposals to set an Asset to Unknown

### Human Review Process

1. **Proposal Assignment** - Proposals are routed to appropriate analysts based on expertise and workload
2. **Evidence Review** - Analysts examine scan results, screenshots, metadata, and context
3. **Decision Making** - Using established criteria and guidelines, analysts make Approve/Reject/Skip/Escalate decisions
4. **Quality Assurance** - Decisions feed back into our AI models to improve future automation accuracy

### What Analysts Use to Make Decisions

**Asset Scan Results** - Screenshots and visual evidence, page content and metadata, network and infrastructure data, historical scan timeline.

**Detection Rules** - Which rules triggered and their confidence levels, rule weights and scoring breakdown, legitimacy rule results.

**Context & Intelligence** - Related assets and infrastructure, reporter information and history, brand-specific guidelines, recent threat patterns.

**Organization Settings** - Custom detection thresholds, allowlist and blocklist entries, brand protection priorities.

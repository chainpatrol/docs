## Overview

In order to block malicious threats or allow official assets, we use the Review process. To change an Asset's status (from `UNKNOWN` to `BLOCKED`/`ALLOWED`, or in special cases between `BLOCKED` and `ALLOWED`), we create a **Proposal**.

<Info>
Each Proposal is evaluated by either human reviewers or our automation, who can make one of four decisions: **Approve**, **Reject**, **Skip**, or **Escalate**.
</Info>

### Proposal Decisions

- **Approve** - Accepts the Asset's status change and closes the Proposal
- **Reject** - Denies the status change and closes the Proposal
- **Skip** - Keeps Proposal pending when there's insufficient evidence
- **Escalate** - Sends to senior team members or customer for additional review

Only **Approve** and **Reject** decisions close out the Proposal. **Skip** and **Escalate** keep the Proposal in `PENDING` status for further evaluation.

## Automation

Our automated review system handles high-confidence threat detections, allowing human analysts to focus on edge cases and complex decisions.

### When Do We Perform Automated Review?

Automated review is enabled when specific conditions are met:

**Organization Requirements** - Reviewing automation only activates for organizations with an active subscription status (Active, Trial, or Prospect).

**Asset Information Requirements** - Automation requires sufficient data about the Asset. Some platforms currently lack adequate information gathering capabilities. Platforms requiring human review include Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok due to limited automated data collection.

**Proposal Type Restrictions** - Automated review only handles Proposals to set an Asset to `BLOCKED` status. Proposals to set Assets to `ALLOWED` or `UNKNOWN` status are not automated.

### How Does Automated Review Make a Decision?

Our automated review system calculates a **risk score** to determine whether an asset should be approved as malicious.

1. **Rule Execution** - During an Asset Scan, multiple detection rules are executed against the asset
2. **Score Calculation** - The risk score is a weighted sum of all individual scores from each successful rule execution
3. **Threshold Evaluation** - The final risk score is compared against our approval threshold
4. **Decision** - Assets meeting the threshold are automatically approved; others are escalated for human review

### Legitimacy Rules

<Warning>
**Special Case:** Legitimacy Rules can override automatic approval, even with high risk scores.
</Warning>

Legitimacy Rules are special detection rules that identify when an asset is **not malicious**. If a Legitimacy Rule with "Very High" confidence passes, automation will **not** automatically approve the Proposal, regardless of the Risk Score.

**Example:** An asset might have a high risk score, but if it matches a Very High confidence Legitimacy Rule (e.g., verified official domain), the Proposal will be escalated for human review instead of being auto-blocked.

### Automatically Approving the Proposal

For a Proposal to be automatically approved, **all** of the following must be true:

**Required Conditions:**
- Asset must not already be `ALLOWED`
- Organization must have Reviewing enabled and not be inactive
- Proposal must be for blocking the Asset (not for allowing)
- No Legitimacy Rules of "Very High" confidence have passed

**Approval Triggers (at least one must be true):**
- **Option 1:** High Risk Score (the overall Risk Score of the Asset meets our confidence threshold)
- **Option 2:** Trusted Reporter (the Asset was part of a Report created by a Trusted Reporter)

## Human Review

Humans are essential for making decisions about Proposals that fall outside automated approval criteria.

Since automation only handles Proposals to block Assets with high confidence scores, human analysts evaluate all other cases.

### When Humans Are Involved

- **Lower Confidence Blocks** - Proposals to Block an Asset that doesn't meet the automated threshold
- **Allow Proposals** - All Proposals to Allow an Asset
- **Unknown Status** - Proposals to set an Asset to Unknown

### Human Review Process

1. **Proposal Assignment** - Proposals are routed to appropriate analysts based on expertise and workload
2. **Evidence Review** - Analysts examine scan results, screenshots, metadata, and context
3. **Decision Making** - Using established criteria and guidelines, analysts make Approve/Reject/Skip/Escalate decisions
4. **Quality Assurance** - Decisions feed back into our AI models to improve future automation accuracy

### What Analysts Use to Make Decisions

**Asset Scan Results** - Screenshots and visual evidence, page content and metadata, network and infrastructure data, historical scan timeline.

**Detection Rules** - Which rules triggered and their confidence levels, rule weights and scoring breakdown, legitimacy rule results.

**Context & Intelligence** - Related assets and infrastructure, reporter information and history, brand-specific guidelines, recent threat patterns.

**Organization Settings** - Custom detection thresholds, allowlist and blocklist entries, brand protection priorities.

## Key Takeaways

- Reviews evaluate proposals that change an asset’s status (blocked/allowed/unknown)
- Proposals can be approved, rejected, skipped, or escalated
- Automation handles high-confidence blocks under specific conditions
- Human reviewers handle lower-confidence cases and all allow/unknown proposals

**Brand impersonation** is a type of threat where attackers create fraudulent content that mimics a legitimate brand's identity to deceive users. This includes fake websites, social media profiles, apps, and other digital content designed to appear as if they are officially associated with your organization.

## Common forms of brand impersonation

### Phishing websites

Attackers create websites that closely resemble your official site, often using similar domain names, logos, and design elements. These sites are used to steal credentials, private keys, or trick users into malicious transactions.

### Social media impersonation

Fake accounts on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and other social networks that pretend to represent your brand. These accounts often promote scams, distribute malware, or direct users to phishing sites.

### App impersonation

Fraudulent applications in app stores or browser extension marketplaces that use your brand name, logo, and description to appear legitimate while actually stealing user data or funds.

### Domain squatting

Registration of domain names that are similar to your official domains (typosquatting, homograph attacks, or adding common prefixes/suffixes) to capture users who make typing errors or are not paying close attention.

## How ChainPatrol detects brand impersonation

ChainPatrol uses a combination of automated detection and human review to identify brand impersonation:

- **Automated scanning** across 50+ platforms including social media, app stores, domain registrations, and web hosting services
- **AI-assisted analysis** to evaluate content similarity, visual elements, and behavioral patterns
- **Community reports** from your team and the public through web interface or Slack integration
- **Relationship mapping** to identify connected threats and coordinated impersonation campaigns

When brand impersonation is detected and confirmed, ChainPatrol automatically:

1. Blocks the malicious content across partner platforms (wallets, browsers, DNS resolvers)
2. Initiates takedown requests with hosting providers, domain registrars, and social platforms
3. Updates public blocklists to protect the broader community

description: Represents a wallet address or smart contract address on the Ethereum blockchain.
---

Addresses are the identifiers of users and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. They are 20 bytes long and are usually represented in hexadecimal form.

When submitting a report, you can provide the address of the wallet or smart contract you are reporting on and we'll detect if it's a valid Ethereum address based on the `0x` prefix and the length of the address.

## Normalization

We normalize addresses by converting the characters to lowercase.

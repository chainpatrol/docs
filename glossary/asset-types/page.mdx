The `PAGE` asset type is used to report webpages on a domain. Unlike `URL` asset type, the `PAGE` asset type will NOT normalize the URL string before submitting to **Chainpatrol**.

This allows you to report webpages on sites where the scam or malicious content is hosted on a subpath of the domain.

When you submit a report, if you submit a URL that matches one of the domains below, a `PAGE` asset will be created instead of a `URL` asset.

#### Available page domains

```
bit.ly
blur.io
goo.gl
link3.to
linktr.ee
opensea.io
t.co
t.me
telegram.me
tinyurl.com
twitter.com
beacons.ai
```

<Note>
